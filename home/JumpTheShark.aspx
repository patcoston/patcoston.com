<p>Jumping the shark is that defining moment when your show reaches its peak and 
you know its all downhill from there.
<hr size="4" color="gray">
<p>I had never heard the expression "Jumped the Shark" until a few days before I 
created this web page. I was listening to the Howard Stern show and they were 
interviewing Henry Winkler who played the Fonz on Happy Days. Howard said 
"Happy days really went downhill after the episode where you jumped the shark 
with your motorcycle." I didn't think much of that comment until that night I 
was browsing the web and I happened across a site called <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/">
Jump the Shark</a>. Later that day I was watching a documentary on the 
Little Rascals and they were talking about when Hal Roach sold the rights to 
MGM and the show went downhill. I totally agreed and thought I should start my 
own "Jumped the Shark" web page.

<li>

<li>
<strong>Batman</strong>

<li>
<strong>Battlebots</strong>
- never jumped. I never miss an episode although through the magic of Tivo I 
can fast-forward through all of the lame commentary and get to the good 
stuff</strong> - the carnage! They had some lame interviewers liked those twin guys 
but the worse commentary is from Carmen Electra. She's hot, but she's got 
nothing meaningful to say. I would like to see even more violence than exists 
now and fights to the death instead of a 3 minute limit with scoring.

- When Tom Wopat (Luke) and John Schneider (Bo) left the show and was replaced 
by those other two "Coy" and "Vance"
<li>
<strong>Earth 2</strong>
- jumped after pilot episode. Too many aliens and other humans. I was looking 
forward to a "humans vs the elements" show but it turned into something else
<li>
<strong>The Equalizer </strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Empty Nest</strong>
- when Kristy McNichol left. She was the only reason I liked that show.
<li>
<strong>Everwood</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>F-Troop</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Facts of Life</strong>
- when Mrs. Garret left the show and the girls grew up and were no longer cute, 
especially Blaire gaining weight and Tootie growing up.
<li>
<strong>Family Ties</strong>
- This show jumped the shark twice. It started going downhill when Jennifer hit 
puberty and started gaining weight. Her character was originally a tomboy who 
liked baseball and soccer but when she got older, she changed into this dress 
wearing fat girl. The show went downhill further when Andrew was born. The kid 
grew a few years in one season. It didn't make any sense. Andrew was so 
horrible. If you watch closely, you'll see that the kid isn't paying attention 
and that he's cued to say his line on time. There's always someone right next 
to him to tap him and then he'll just say his line.
<li>
<strong>Far Out Space Nuts</strong>
- jumped day 1. Gilligan in space! A rip-off of Abbot &amp; Costello go to 
Mars! Too bad they never did a crossover episode with "The Lost Saucer" which 
also sucked.
<li>
<strong>Farscape</strong>
- Jumped when Virginia Hey (she played Zhaan, the tall bald blue woman) left 
the show. Got worse when Scorpius joined the show. But lately its recovered and 
is better than it ever was.
<li>
<strong>Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Flying Nun</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Fear Factor</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Firefly</strong>

never did. The space ship scenes were awesome though.
<li>
<strong>Freaks and Geeks</strong>

<li>
<strong>Hee Haw</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Hogan's Heros</strong>

- when they got married
<li>
<strong>I love Lucy</strong>
- when they moved to Connecticut
<li>

<li>
<strong>Just Shoot Me</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Kids in the Hall</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Kung Fu</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Land of the Lost</strong>

stupid this was.
<li>
<strong>Land of the Giants</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Larry Sanders Show</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Leave it to Beaver</strong>
- when Beaver got older, he was no longer cute.
<li>
<strong>Lexx</strong>
- never jumped. In season two they killed off Zev (Eva Habermann) and replaced 
with her with Xev (Xenia Seeberg). I liked Xev better than Zev. Season three 
where they were stranded over the two planets Fire and Water was brilliant. And 
finally Season four when they go to Earth offered many possibilities. Each 
season ended with a great finale. This is one of those shows you either love or 
hate and I'm only aware of one other person who loves this show.
<li>
<strong>Little House on the Prarie</strong>
-
<li>
<strong>Little Rascals</strong>
- when Hal Roach sold the rights to MGM. The next 5 years were terrible. 
Regulars like Spanky and Alfalfa grew too old and were no longer cute. 
Newcomers like Froggy were just plain annoying.
<li>
<strong>Lost in Space</strong>
- When the show went color. Suddenly Will and Dr. Smith were the focus of the 
show and Dr. Smith became a Wussy. Instead of a serious Scifi show, it became 
campy and almost every planet looked like the same set.
<li>
<strong>The Lost Saucer</strong>
- jumped day 1. Jim Nabors and Ruth Buzzi as androids who come to Earth and 
pick up a couple of kids for some fun and wacky space adventures.
<li>
<strong>Malcom in the Middle</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Married ... with Children</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Maybe it's Me</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>M*A*S*H</strong>
- jumped when Klinger stopped dressing like a woman.
<li>
<strong>Miami Vice</strong>
- when the look-n-feel of the show changed from that 80's pink-n-blue to more 
of a dark edgy feel.
<li>
<strong>Mission Impossible</strong>
- jumped when Martin Landau and Barbara Bain left to do Space 1999.
<li>
<strong>The Mole</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Monk</strong>

<li>
<strong>Mork &amp; Mindy</strong>
- the birth of Jonathan Winters as Mearth
<li>
<strong>The Munsters</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Night Court</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Northern Exposure</strong>
- when Joel Flieschman (actor Rob Morrow) left the show and the new Doctor took 
his place.
<li>
<strong>Odd Couple</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Osbournes</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Partridge Family</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Real World</strong>

<li>

<li>
<strong>Roseanne</strong>

<li>
<strong>Quantum Leap</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Quark</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Quincy, ME</strong>
- jumped when Quincy got married
<li>
<strong>Red Dwarf</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Saturday Night Live</strong>
- never jumped but my love for the show varies according to the who cast is. 
The death of Chris Farley was a huge loss. Phil Hartman also died but he left 
the show before that, another big loss. Mike Meyers leaving was huge. Will 
Farrel left and he was carrying the show. But they keep finding fresh talent 
and every week at least one or two skits are absolutely hilarious. Plus I love 
the musical guests sometimes.
<li>
<strong>Scooby Doo</strong>
- when Scrappy Doo joins the cast. First of all, Scooby Doo didn't talk. He 
kind of barked talked. That, at least, was semi-realistic. There were no 
talking animals on the show. Scooby was special. Then suddenly Scrappy Doo 
comes along and he can speak in full sentences??? What the hell!?
<li>
<strong>Scrubs</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Seinfeld</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Sex and the City</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Silver Spoons</strong>
- jumped when Ricky hit puberty and they started calling him Rick
<li>
<strong>The Six Million Dollar Man</strong>
- jumped when it got ridiculous with Sasquatch and the aliens from space
<li>
<strong>The Simpsons</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Sliders</strong>
- jumped three times - the Death of Professor Arturo, introduction of Kromaggs 
and Jerry O'Connel Leaving the show - started out good but got monotonous over 
time.
<li>
<strong>Smallville</strong>
- never jumped. Keeps getting better.
<li>
<strong>Smush</strong>
- jumped on day 1. The concept just didn't work and I didn't like the host. The 
best thing about the show was the female co-host who was incredibly hot and had 
a great personality to match.
<li>
<strong>Son of the Beach</strong>
- jumped on day 1. I realize you either love or hate this show. I hate it.
<li>
<strong>South Park</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Space 1999</strong>
- jumped when Maya joined the cast.
<li>
<strong>Space Ghost: Coast to Coast</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Speed Racer</strong>
- never jumped. Japanese cartoon that thrilled me as a child and I still enjoy 
it today.
<li>
<strong>Square Pegs</strong>
- never jumped. I freakin' loved this show and was blown away when it got 
cancelled.
<li>
<strong>The Starlost</strong>
- never jumped. Although I loved this show when I was a little kid, but I when 
rented all of the episodes at the local video store when I was older, I 
realized what crap this show was. If this shown were on today, I'd rate it as 
jumped after episode one which was actually pretty good. This was a low budget 
Canadian SciFi TV series that ripped off the movie Silent Running. It was 
filmed on video tape which gave it a even more cheap look. I still find the 
concept of a huge arc floating through space a pretty cool idea.
<li>
<strong>Star Gate SG-1</strong>
- jumped on day 1. I never liked this show.
<li>
<strong>Star Trek</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</strong>
-
<li>
<strong>Star Trek: The Next Generation</strong>
- When Wesley started saving the Enterprise every episode and Riker (Number 1) 
grew a beard.
<li>
<strong>Star Trek: Enterprise</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Survivor</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Taxi</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>That 70's Show</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>That 80's Show</strong>
- jumped day 1</strong> - I gave this show a chance and watched it for quite a while 
but it started lame never got good.
<li>
<strong>3rd Rock from the Sun</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Three's Company</strong>
- jumped when Chrissy left
<li>
<strong>The Tic</strong>
- never jumped. One of the funniest shows ever.
<li>
<strong>3 South</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Twilight Zone</strong>
- jumped when they started having one hour episodes. 30 minutes was already too 
long! The shows were great but they could have been pulled off in 15 minutes.
<li>
<strong>Tracey Ullman Show</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>Twin Peaks</strong>
- jumped on day 1. I disliked that show more and more after each episode. I've 
had it with David Lynch. His stuff is just way too bizarre for me. Eraserhead 
is the most extreme followed by Wild at Heart followed by Blue Velvet followed 
by Lost Highway. Ick.
<li>
<strong>Undeclared</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>underGrads</strong>
- never jumped
<li>

<strong>Welcome Back Kotter</strong>

<li>
<strong>Wild Survival</strong>

<li>
<strong>WKRP in Cincinnati</strong>
- never jumped
<li>
<strong>The Wonder Years</strong>
- The first episode blew me away but the concept couldn't last for long. It 
eventually got old and Kevin and Winnie grew up and stopped being cute, 
similarly what happened with Leave it to Beaver or the Little Rascals.
<li>
<strong>Zoom</strong> - never jumped</li>
