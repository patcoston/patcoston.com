<h2>Shows I'm watching as of August 2010</h2>

<p />I'm still watching all of my TV on DVD from NetFlix.
I finished watching every episode of Six Feet Under and Flight of the Conchords.  Both shows were amazing.
Except for the classics like Mission Impossible, Gilligan's Island and Lost in Space,
I have not started watching the following shows yet but they are all about to be released in the next month.
I had maxed out my NetFlix account at 8 DVDs at a time and I was keeping up with that pace until I got side-tracked
on other personal projects so I cut myself back to 3 DVDS at a time.

<ul>
<li>Lost (Season 6)</li>
<li>Heroes (Season 4)</li>
<li>Dexter (Season 4)</li>
<li>House, M.D. (Season 6)</li>

<h2>Shows I'm watching as of September 2007</h2>

<p />I'm still living in a crowded house of TV addicts including many children who want to watch cartoons all day
so I am giving up watching TV until I can return to the US and catch up watching my missed seasons of TV on DVD via
NetFlix.  Now the only thing I watch is Podcasts.  The ones I mainly watch are ...

<ul>
<li>Rocketboom (PC)</li>
<li>Diggnation (PC)</li>
<li>The Totally Rad Show (PC)</li>
<li>iFanboy (PC)</li>
<li>MTV News (PC)</li>
<li>National Geographic (PC)</li>
<li>Weird America (PC)</li>
<li>Indy Mogal (PC)</li>
<li>CNN - In case you missed (PC)</li>
<li>MoBuzzTV (PC)</li>
<li>Access Hollywood (PC)</li>
<li>Discovery Channel (PC)</li>
<li>Channel Frederator (PC)</li>
</ul>

Other podcasts are audio only for example Twit, TalkCrunch and ScobleShow.
My lack of TV has allowed me to explore these many alternatives including audible books.

<p />I joined NetFlix since we are moving from Malaysia to USA in a week.
I see that they have many of my favorite TV shows on DVD so I plan to catch-up on DVD
since I have missed a lot of TV.  Shows currently in my NetFlix queue are ...

<ul>
<li>Lost</li>
<li>Heroes</li>
<li>Grey's Anatomy</li>
<li>That 70's Show</li>
<li>Scrubs</li>
<li>The Office</li>
<li>Undeclared</li>
<li>Freaks and Geeks</li>
<li>Arrested Development</li>
<li>Six Feet Under</li>
<li>Dead Like Me</li>
<li>Gilmore Girls</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shows I'm watching as of July 2006</h2>

<p />For the past two months I've stopped watching the Television and have shifted to
watching TV on the Internet.  It all started when I was checking
out <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> and I came across <a href="http://www.asemblr.com/">Asemblr</a>
which had links to entire seasons of shows I liked.
Asemblr does not host any of the content, they simply link to it but I discovered
that sites like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and
<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/">DailyMotion</a> had entire episodes of shows I liked!
Watching TV on the Internet is actually more convenient for me since I live in a crowded
house of TV watchers and the only time I could really have the TV to myself was after 2 am.
But lately I've started to sleep at around 1 am so that stopped being an option so now
100% of my TV viewing is Interenet.  Here are some of the shows I'm watching.

<ul>
<li>The Office</li>
<li>Heroes</li>
<li>Mythbusters</li>
<li>Penn & Teller: Bullshit!</li>
<li>That 70s Show</li>
<li>Friends</li>
<li>Futurama</li>
<li>Metalocalypse</li>
<li>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</li>
<li>South Park</li>
<li>The Venture Brothers</li>
<li>Sealab 2021</li>
<li>Family Guy</li>
<li>Clerks</li>
<li>American Dad</li>
<li>Weeds</li>
<li>The Simpsons</li>
<li>The IT Crowd</li>
<li>Jackass</li>
<li>Firefly</li>
<li>3rd Rock From the Sun</li>
<li>Viva La Bam</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shows I'm watching as of July 2006</h2>

I noticed a trend.  I like to watch shows about smart people solving problems
like CSI, House, M.D., Numb3rs and Mythbusters.

<ul>
<li>Lost (Season 2)</li>
<li>CSI (Season 6)</li>
<li>CSI:NY</li>
<li>House, M.D.</li>
<li>Numb3rs</li>
<li>Fear Factor</li>
<li>Mythbusters</li>
</ul>

<hr />

Shows I'm watching as of April 2006.

<ul>
<li>Lost (Season 2)</li>
<li>CSI (Season 6)</li>
<li>CSI:NY</li>
<li>Mythbusters</li>
<li>The Amazing Race (season 9)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Shows I'm watching as of January 2006</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lost (Season 1)</li>
</ul>

How did I go from watching 49 shows to 1 show?
I moved to <a href="adventure/asia/default.aspx">Malaysia</a> and got married and everything changed.
Actually I rarely watch TV.  I'm watching Season 1 of Lost on DVD on my PC.
I'm living with my wife Kelly and her family and they have the TV on all day.

<p>This is a full-house filled with parents, sisters and kids and the demand for the TV is very high.
I tried watching Lost on TV but it conflicted with other shows people wanted to watch.
So I purchased Season 1 on DVD.  It's the pirated version which cost me about $2 per disk.</p>

<p>Previously I had Tivo to help me watch my favorite shows but here in Malaysia</p>

<a href="http://patrick-james-coston-asian-adventures.blogspot.com/2005/11/no-tivo.html">they don't have Tivo</a>.
They also don't have VCRs.  Recording TV is not something they do.

<p>I predict that once we get a place of our own, I'll get a TV with a Tivo and start
watching more TV again.  Unfortunately Malaysia is a year behind on most TV shows.
I tried to watch NUMB3RS, CSI, CSI Miami, CSI New York, Battlestar Galactica and a few
other shows but they were a year old and I had already seen them.  Most of the shows
I like aren't available in Malaysia.</p>

<p>If I'm really desperate, I can always download TV shows from the Internet.</p>

<hr />

Here are the shows I'm watching as of February 2005.
49 shows totalling about 35 hours per week!
In reality I watch far less than that thanks to Tivo
since I skip commercials, credits or parts I don't feel like watching.
I also only watch First Runs and rarely watch an episode twice except
for these shows: Malcolm in the Middle, Gilmore Girls,
The Venture Brothers, Made, Viva La Bam, Drawn Together, Mission Hill, Scooby Doo.
My 4 year old nephew likes to watch TV with me so we've been watching
Scooby Doo, Static Shock, Teen Titans, Teenage Mutan Ninja Turtles, Spider-Man.
I wouldn't normally watch those shows except for Teen Titans.
For Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi I don't watch the cartoon.  Only the 20 second bits
that Ami and Yumi do in real life.  I FF thru American Idol, Distraction,
Saturday Night Live, The Playbook, Coming Attractions and just watch parts
that look interesting.  The family likes to gather and watch Amazing Race,
The Apprentice, American Idol, Survivor.  My favorite TV shows right now are
Ghost in the Shell, Mission Hill, NUMB3RS, Monk, Ebert & Roeper, Cowboy Bebop,
Gilmore Girls, Malcolm in the Middle.
The Cartoon Channel has Adult Swim which is a collection of late night shows.
I watch Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, Harvey Birdman:Attorney at Law,
Super Milk Chan, The Venture Brothers.
I love all three CSI shows.  I watch 14 Cartoons, 9 Reality shows, 9 Dramas, 6 Sitcoms, 2 SciFi.
