<p /><strong><h3>Music I'm listening to as of January 2010.</h3></strong>

<p>I moved to Ewing, New Jersey so now I listen to <a href="http://www.radio1045.com/main.html">radio 104.5</a> which plays alternative rock for example
Weezer, Offspring, Nirvana, Muse, Soundgarden, Vampire Weekend, Stroke 9, Jack Johnson, Jimmy Eat World, Snow Patrol, Incubus, etc.</p>

<p>I am continuing to expand my library on iTunes.  I bought the box set of The Beatles the day it was released about a month ago.
Other albums I bought recently are from bands like Arcade Fire, Cat Stevens, ELO, Kings of Leon, Jeff Buckley, Simon & Garfunkel, Sonic Youth, Weezer, Yes, Paul McCartney & Wings, OK Go, MGMT, Muse, The Knack, George Harrison, Coldplay and Brian Wilson.
Although I'm into the new alternative rock, I'm also into exploring music from my past from the 60s and 70s.</p>

<p>One of my favorite songs is from a band called The Go! Team called Huddle Formation which I first heard on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/patcoston#p/a/f/0/qx0pU_u4Q9E">YouTube</a>.
Another song I really like is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMrlHHVx8A">Kings and Queens</a> by 30 Seconds to Mars.
I also heard the Beatles song called <a href="http://auralmemories.blogspot.com/2009/01/beatles-its-all-too-much.html">It's All Too Much</a> for the first time and realized it
has a guitar riff used by Michael Jackson in the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2AitTPI5U0">Black or White</a>.</p>

<p /><strong><h3>Music I'm listening to as of July 2009.</h3></strong>

<p />I switched from Napster to iTunes listening to music at work and on the car radio.
I primarily listen to <a href="http://www.kroq.com/">KROQ FM 106.7</a> here in Los Angeles, California.
KROQ had an Incubus marathon to promote an Incubus concent and
I discovered that I really liked Incubus.  I had heard a lot of their songs but not connected the dots.
I can't pick just one favorite since I love so many of their songs like Pardon Me, Black Heart Inertia,
Wish You Were Here, Stellar, their cover of the Prince song Let's Go Crazy and Are You In.

<p />I saw the movie Southland Tales and in it was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhois-aiYs">music video</a> with Justin Timberlake lip-syncing
to the Killer's song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ERe23kSBM">All These Things That I've Done</a>.
I became an immediate fan of the Killers.  I love all their songs including "Andy, You're a Star", Midnight Show and "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine".

<p />I saw the movie Disturbia and in it was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTKPAyoJwNA">music video</a> featuring the music of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kingsofleon?blend=1&ob=4">Kings of Leon</a>
for the song Taper Jean Girl.  I started checking our their music and became an immediate fan.
I love every Kings of Leon song I've heard so far including Crawl, Sex on Fire, Use Somebody, 17, Revelry and Manhattan.

<p />I hear a lot of great music on the radio but I don't know who most of these bands are.
I can't wait until I can get iTunes tagging.  I'll discover a lot more bands that way.

<p /><strong><h3>Music I'm listening to as of June 2008.</h3></strong>

<p />I listen to music at work with my head-phones.  None of the computers at work have speakers
so everyone uses head-phones.  I primary listen to the following bands via Napster.

<ul>
<li>Modest Mouse - favorite songs: Take me out and Float On</li>
<li>Flaming Lips - favorite song: Do You Realize??</li>
<li>Franz Ferdinand - favorite song: Missed The Boat</li>
<li>Death Cab for Cutie - favorite song: I Will Possess Your Heart</li>
<li>MGMT - favorite song: Time To Pretend</li>
<li>Weezer - the red album rulez!  favorite song from that album: Miss Sweeny</li>
</ul>

I used to get my mp3s from http://www.emusic.com/ but I would only get 30 per month and that wasn't enough.
I decided to switch to either Napster or iTunes.  I researched both and decided Napster fits my needs better.
I'd rather pay one price for all you can eat.  Some songs on Napster require you buy them to listen to more than
the 30 second sample.  Today for example, I heard a song on the radio that I liked and learned who it was and now
I'm listening to all their music for no extra cost.  If I was using iTunes, I would have had to pay for each song
or album.  I found Napster's collecting lacking at times for example they have no real Beatles collection but
I'm sure iTunes is lacking in areas.  Nobody can have it all.  I've also enjoyed listening to a lot of comedians
on Napster.  My mp3 collection is gathering dust now.

<p />I also listen to the radio and favorite station is <a href="http://www.1019rxp.com/">101.9 FM RXP New York</a> because
they have an amazing mix of old and new for example they would play The Who, Radiohead, Queen, U2, David Bowie,
Talking Heads, Coldplay, Ramones, AC/DC, Black Crowes, Tom Petty, INXS, Police, Eddie Vedder, REM, Kinks,
Evis Costello, Clash, Beck, Buzzcocks, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Aerosmith, Led Zepplin, Lou Reed, Link Park,
MGMT, Boston, Pearl Jam, Weezer, Sheryl Crow, Grateful Dead, Offspring, Jimmy Eat World, Proclaimers,
White Stripes, Allman Brothers, Third Eye Blind, Stray Cats, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Beastie Boys, Doors,
Stone Temple Pilots, Cheap Trick, Bare Naked Ladies, Cake, Death Cab for Cutie, Spoon, Flaming Lips,
Cars, Depeche Mode, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, Dave Matthew Band, Santana, Incubus, Pretenders,
Ozzy Osbourne, Beatles, The Kooks, Eagle Eye Cherry, Suicide Blonde, Franz Ferdinand, Smashing Pumpkins,
Rush, Peter Gabrielle, Foo Fighters, Nirvana, Supergrass, My Morning Jacket, Modest Mouse, Tonic, The Verve.
