For me, this poem is a celebration of individuality.<br />
These final three lines describe how I lead my life.<br />
I enjoy taking a different path in life than most.

<p /><span style="font-style: italic;">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--<br />
I took the one less traveled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.</span><br />

<p /><strong>Robert Frost<br />
The Road Not Taken</strong>
<p />
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
And sorry I could not travel both<br />
And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
And looked down one as far as I could<br />
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
<p />
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
Though as for that the passing there<br />
Had worn them really about the same,<br />
<p />
And both that morning equally lay<br />
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
<p />
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--<br />
I took the one less traveled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.<br />
