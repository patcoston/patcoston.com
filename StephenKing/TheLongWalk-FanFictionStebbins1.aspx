<h2>The Long Walk: Fan Fiction: Chapter 1: Stebbins Shines: Back Story</h2>

<pre>

***************************************************************
They call me The Major.  Today is May 5, 1979.  My son died today in the 23rd Annual Long Walk.
His full name was Jake Nijuroku Edwards.
His cover name was Bartholomew Stebbins.
He was named after me since my real name is Jake Thomas Edwards.
He was my twenty-fifth son.  To call him my son is a misnomer.  He's actually my twenty-fifth clone.
His middle name, Nijurou, means Twenty Five in Japanese.  All of my clones have my name,
except their middle name is their version number in Japanese.
My first clone is Jake iti Edwards, second is Jake ni Edwards, and third is Jake san Edwards, and so on.
I changed my middle name to nuru, since that means zero in Japanese.  I am version zero.

Each of my sons has a cover name which they use in the real world so
they don't get linked back to me.  In The Shop, everyone refers to them as Boosted Boys,
aka BB1, BB2, BB3, etc.  Not only do they all possess some
level of mind powers, but the ones that are accepted to The Long Walk, are boosted further
by artificial means, giving them an unfair advantage.  And yet, of the nine Boosted Boys that have
qualified for The Long Walk, none have won.

With billions bet each year on The Long Walk, many of the boys cheat.
And yet, the boy who won this year, did not cheat.  That I am certain.
But Raymond Davis Garraty had help, even though he didn't know it.
The real puppet master of this year's Long Walk was Peter McVries.

Lot 1 1950
Lot 2 1954
Lot 3 1958

Lot 7 1974

Lot 9 1982

Major finds out about the Lot 1 experiment because of a sequence of events that caused him to sit next to his friend on the bus. His friend told him to join him, make a quick $100. It was full, but someone else was a victim of unlikely events, and was late, and lost his spot. 

No side effects, but months after the experiment, the side effects started. Eyes and skin sensitive to sun. High sex drive combined with giving off pheromones. Fathers clones of himself. 

I'm drawing inspiration from my life.  It seems that life has its way of sending me off in new directions through tiny events I don't even notice.  That's how the Major (before he's known as the Major) will learn about the Lot 1 experiment by The Shop.

At age 24, I will still a virgin, but my sex drive was so high as to be annoying, like a constant stress.  I did lose it at age 24.  The Major's sex-drive will spike due to side-effects from Lot 1 resulting in his many bastards.  He'll also give off a sex pheromones, making it easier to get women into bed.  They'll all be boys because they'll all be clones of the Major.

I've considered making the Major's real name to be Bart Stebbins (no middle name).  All of his sons will be named Bart Stebbins, and get a version number for their middle name in Japanese (the Major likes Anime).  Bart iti Stebbins, Bart ni Stebbins, Bart san Stebbins, and the Major will be named Bart nuru Stebbins.

The Stebbins in the book is bastard 25 so his full name is Bartholomew Nijuroku Stebbins.

Given it's the 23rd Annual Long Walk in 1979, and 8 of Stebbins half-brothers died in The Long Walk, you might think someone would notice that he's the 9th Bart Stebbins to enter.  I need to figure a way around this conundrum.

NOTES: More stories of boosted-boys using their powers to win. Mind control to make boys walk off the road, or maybe fall asleep.
or maybe not thirsty, so gets dehydrated

<strong>Jan 5, 1950:</strong> 
Jake Edwards, age 26, was struggling financially when he learned of an experiment at the college that paid $100.
He and nine others were given an experimental drug which was related to LSD, to test its affects in the brain and body.
The U.S. Department of Scientific Intelligence (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shop_(Stephen_King)">The Shop</a>)
was behind this experiment.
As a result of the experiment, Jake had the following side-effects:
* Eyes and skin sensitive to light. Any skin tanning was permanent.
* Libido amplified
Later he tried to sell his sperm for money, but they told him that his sperm count was zero.  He was sterile.
He wondered if that too was a side-effect from the Lot 1 experiment.

<strong>1950-1961:</strong>
Previously a shy virgin, he now found woman drawn to him sexually, and men would say that he smelled very masculine.
What he didn't know was that the Lot 1 experiment had yet another side-effect.
His body was releasing two to five times the normal amount of sex pheromones.
With his libido amplified, he didn't turn away any woman who wanted sex with him.
He had sex with hundreds of women each year.
Knowing that he was sterile, he only used protection if women requested it, which was about half the time.
In 1953, he had his first kid, a boy.
His sperm count was making a come-back.
Edwards fathered 24 boys in these 11 years.
It's not that his chromosomes were forcing male children.
Some woman would get pregnant with females, but the pregnancies would always self abort.
Some of the women would decide to have an abortion rather than have a bastard.
The Shop monitored these boys as they grew, to see if they had any DNA abnormalities.
They discovered that some of his boys would exhibit various levels of psychic ability.
They had various levels of telepathy, mind-control, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, psychokinesis, clairvoyance,
and other powers-of-the-mind which could be weaponized by The Shop.
All the mothers were given financial support to raise the boys,
as long as they never reveal who the father is.
Not even to the boy.

<strong>May 1, 1957:</strong>
The first Long Walk occurs. See <a href="TheLongWalk-SpectatorGuide.aspx#history">History of The Long Walk</a> for more info.

<strong>1961:</strong>
Edwards came up with the idea that all his bastard sons should be adopted and raised by soldiers in the Squads as
part of a new research project to produce super-soldiers. They could be trained and monitored more closely.
It was decided to wait until each boy turned 12 before force-adopting them into the family of a squad member.
The mother's compensation would be tripled for life. They would not allow contact with their son until he turned 18.

<strong>May 3, 1961:</strong>
Edwards has sex with Samantha Stebbins, while shacked up in Augusta on day 3 of the 11th running of The Long Walk.
At the time, he was just spectator, still working for the Shop, in charge of monitoring the progress of his various sons.
He managed the child-support and testing for each of his boys. He thought with the right training, one of his sons could win The Long Walk.
They were, after all, a superior breed of human, he thought.

<strong>Nov 19, 1961:</strong>
Edwards 26th bastard-son is born. His Christian unwed mother names him Bartholomew, after one of the twelve apostles.

<strong>1965:</strong>
Edwards oldest boy turns 12 and is the first adoption by a soldier in the Squads.

<strong>1966:</strong>
The Long Walk is <a href="TheLongWalk-SpectatorGuide.aspx#squads">taken over by the Squads</a>.

<strong>1962-1968:</strong>
Edwards continued to have sex with many women and have many more bastard sons for these 7 years,
encouraged and financially supported by The Shop to create more research subjects.
He continued to manage the project which he code named MOKINGBIRD, simply because he liked
the popular movie "To Kill a Mockingbird" which came out in 1962.

<strong>Jan 5, 1968:</strong> Exactly 18 years after his accident, Edwards, now age 44, took over the leadership on The Long Walk
after the Squads took over from The Long Walk&reg; Corporation and shifted control to the Department of The Long Walk back in 1966.
Edwards was branded as "The Major", and became the front-man for The Long Walk, selecting the 200 names out of the drum on the televised event,
giving speeches, greeting the walkers at the start, and greeting the winner at the end.

The Major was never in the military, but he played the part. Misinformation is passed out to the press so the public
thinks The Major is some kind of society-supported sociopath, and the rarest and most dangerous monster any nation can produce.
It's all a sham though, just to make The Major seem more important than he really was and get the fear and respect of everyone around him.

<strong>May 3, 1968:</strong>
The Shop, wanting to test their new super soldier children, who had been in training with their squad fathers,
secretly slipped the Major's oldest bastard, now age 15, into the 12th Annual Long Walk.
They lowered the age limit to 15, just so he could be entered.
Although he was able to get some of the boys eliminated through subtle mind-control,
he got his ticket on day 3 from leg cramps.

<strong>1969:</strong>
The second bastard son of The Major is secretly entered into the 13th Annual Long Walk.
They had to shift the cut-off date from April 1 to May 1 because his 15th birthday was April 20.
Boys can be underage when they applied, if they were old enough on the day of the long walk.
This time they injected experimental muscle implants into his leg muscles
to help prevent cramps, improve endurance and assist with pacing.
It didn't work. His body began to reject the implants after on day 2.
His leg muscles spasmed making it impossible for him to walk so he bought his ticket.

<strong>1970:</strong>
The age limit was lowered to 14 so the third oldest bastard of the Major
could be secretly entered into the 14st Annual Long Walk.
He was born November 3, 1955 and was only 14 on May 1, 1970.
He had new and improved implants injected into his legs and hip muscles six months before the Long Walk
so they could be tested to make sure his body would not reject them.
The testing showed no problems but on day 5, when it was down to the final two walkers,
the pain in back and shoulders was too great. He lost the will to continue and just lay down
and bought his hole.

<strong>1971:</strong>
The age limit was lowered again to 13 to allow the most promising bastard
to be entered into the Long Walk. This was B12. They had begun to give each boy code names
based on his birth order. B4 to B11 were <a href="#bastards">eliminated from consideration</a> for various reasons like
too much empathy or sympathy, too friendly, or not enough shine.
B12 is secretly entered into the 15th Annual Long walk, but this time the implants are in his
legs, hips, backs, and shoulders, and that seemed to be the winning combination,
but nature had other ideas on night 4. Five boys were hit by lightning at 11:10 PM
during a heavy rain-storm, including B12. All died immediately except B12, but
the electrical jolt had fried his implants. He continued on for two more hours before slowing.
He was 30 seconds away from getting his ticket when he used his mental powers to get help from a fellow walker.
He leaned on them and kept walking, but after a few hours, they both tired.
He used his mental powers to get a few different boys to carry him but they eventually began to tire as well,
and he was exhausted mentally from controlling the boys. He realized it was impossible for him to win,
so he gave up and got his ticket.
Because of this incident, <a href="TheLongWalk-WalkersRuleBook.aspx#rule24">Rule 24</a> was updated forbidding anyone from helping another walker with walking,
which includes carrying or dragging.

<strong>1972: The Slaughter of 72</strong>
B13 is rejected for reasons <a href="#bastards">R4 and R5.</a>
B14 is secretly entered into the 16th Annual Long Walk.
On day 3, a group of 11 rebellious boys, with misdirected anger toward the soldiers,
attacked the halftrack, taking their weapons and killing the soldiers.
Four of the boys were killed during the attack.
The remaining seven boys commandeered the halftrack, then proceeded to hand out tickets to the other walkers including B14.
By the time more soldiers arrived and gave these seven boys their tickets, all walkers had been ticketed,
except for some that escaped off the road. They were given their tickets as well.
Rule 1: You forfeited your right to warnings when you step passed the verge of the shoulder.
A ticket will be issued immediately in this case.

<strong>Feb 11, 1972: </strong>
Bart Stebbins, age 10, shows promise. He was a loner. The loners have a higher chance of winning the Long Walk.
He is also testing low on sympathy and empathy.

<strong>1973:</strong>
It was decided that the next walker should be at least age 16.
B15 B16 B17 were all <a href="#bastards">rejected</a>.
B18 has the right attributes but is only age 14, so they decide to wait until 1975.

<strong>Jun 30, 1974:</strong>
Bart Stebbins, age 12, is given up for adoption to a soldier in the Squads and begins his training and testing.
It was discovered that ...
He had an air of self-important and superiority over other people and had lower empathy than normal.
His personality was perfect for a champion long walker. He was also very intelligent, with a good mind
for solving puzzles and having a good strategy. He could also stay calm in the face of danger.
He had a high tolerance for pain, both physically and mentally.
He had also shown the ability to read a person's thoughts while they are sleeping or dozing (known as the shine),
which meant he could get inside the other walker's minds while they walk-dozed, and learn things
about them which he could leverage to his advantage with psychological warfare.

<strong>Aug 1, 1974:</strong>
B18 is given his muscle implants 9 months in advance of the Long Walk '75
to make sure his body doesn't reject them.

<strong>May 1, 1975:</strong>
B18 is entered secretly into the 19th Annual Long Walk.
Just as the Major was congratulating the boys from completing the first mile
of their journey, a remote-control airplane flew out of nowhere crashing into the
main pack of walkers, striking several walkers.
It was carrying a beehive which burst open.
Most of the boys, except for the Vanguard which was leading by a football field,
were swarmed by the bees and being stung. But the Major and the soldiers seemed
unphased. The boys began to run in all directions, including the wrong direction,
and warnings started to be issued as the radars/sonar devices communicated the speed
of the walkers on the computer console. Boys began to panic and run off the road.
Shots rang out. The four soldiers and the Major were shooting walkers as they left the road
in a blind panic. By the time it was over, 39 walkers had bought their ticket.
B18 was trailing the pack and was not part of the swarm initially, but had no choice
but to run through it. He was knocked over by a walker running blindly in the wrong direction.
About five minutes after cleaning the swarm, he took inventory and counted eleven stings
on his face, neck, hands and chest. What he was about to discover is that he's allergic
to bee venom. He started to get hives and itch around the areas he was stung.
Ten minutes later his face and throat began to swell, and he began to have trouble breathing.
He knew the rules. No medicines allowed. The right medicine would save his life.
He began to feel dizzy and fell over ... first warning ... second warning ...
He passed out. He never did hear the third warning, nor did he see the Major,
his father, give him his ticket.

From that point forward, his bastards would be tested for allergies.
B19 is rejected for the next Long Walk due to allergies.

<strong>May 5, 1975:</strong>
Stebbins (aka B25), age 13, watches the end of The Long Walk with his step-father in the Squads.

<strong>May 6, 1975:</strong>
The next day, curious about The Long Walk, Stebbins begins to research everything he can find on public record.
In his curiosity, he decides to invade his step-father's mind while he sleeps.
It's an ability that takes great concentration.
In the coming week, he was able to piece together fragments that The Major is his real father,
and that he has other half-brothers who are also special like him.
He decides to dig through his step-fathers private paperwork, when he discovers
some paperwork that says the Jake Edwards is his real father.
He doesn't connect Jake Edwards right away, until he finds a photo of Jake Edwards.
Reflector sun-glasses, deep tan, mustache ... everyone knows what the Major looks like. He connects the dots.
The visions he got from his step-father's dreams were correct!
He also learns that he has forty-two half-brothers. "My dad is a randy old sonofabitch!", he speaks to himself.
He also notices that the birth-rate of the Major's bastards is slowing.
Six boys in 1957, seven in 1958, but no boys in 1968, 1971, 1973 and 1974.
The paperwork did not contain their names, only their code names. He figured out by the birthdays that he was B25.
Stebbins wondered if he had any sisters. Now his obsession with having sex made sense.
He inherited his dad's first-class libido. He wondered if he would have forty-two bastards of his own someday.

<strong>May 18, 1975</strong>
About two weeks later, Stebbins step-father tells him that he will be secretly entered into the Long Walk.
His step-father assures him that he has a 100% chance of winning because of the muscle implants he will receive when he's 16.
Stebbins asks him who his real father is. His step-father lies to him, giving him the standard story as outlined in the
DoTLW parental-guidelines and told Stebbins that his father died in a car crash after he was born.
His step-father also tells him that mis mother still loves him, but she gave him up for adoption, so he could be
trained by the squads to win the Long Walk someday, and that he could be reunited with his mother
when he turned 18. That was the truth.

<strong>Aug 10, 1975</strong>
The Major's last boy, B42, was born. The rate in which he fathered boys had been dropping off to one every few years.
His sperm count had finally dropped to zero.  After 42 boys, Project Mockingbird would continue with his remaining sons,
and their sons, and their sons, and so on.

<strong>1976:</strong>
The Shop began experimenting with brain-implants for the soldiers to reduce or remove their empathy toward the walkers.
There had been incidents were soldiers were unable to give a ticket to a walker if that walker reminded them of a family member.
This tech could be activated while they were on duty, then disabled afterwards so they could lead normal lives.
The unfortunate side-effect was that it made the soldiers slow to react and interfered with their ability to aim.
Rather than giving a walker a single clean painless ticket, they often had to shoot multiple times.
The solution that worked most of the time was for multiple soldiers to shoot at the same time, but there were still misses,
and ricochets that would hit other soldiers, walkers or spectators.
Their slow reactions made it possible for rebellious walkers to overtake a soldier, taking their carbine rifles and shooting them with it.
In an attempt to discourage this, a walker who attacked a soldier would be gut-shot, then allowed to die a slow painful death
to deter future attacks. But this would sometimes backfire as it would increase the anger and create more rebellion.

B20 passes all tests and is secretly added to the 20th Annual Long Walk.
He was accidently struck by a bullet ricochet when another walker got his ticket as a result of the empathy dampener on the soldier.
His wound wasn't initially fatal, but it tore a long open cut across his chest. He bled out and eventually passed out,
then got his ticket. Several other walkers and spectators were also injured in other incidents.
The empathy-dampeners needed adjustment.

<strong>1977:</strong>
B21 B22 are <a href="#bastards">rejected for various reasons</a>.
B23 passes all the tests but he is age 16 on May 1, and they decide to wait until next year.

<strong>Aug 1, 1977:</strong>
B23 gets his muscle implants.

<strong>May 1, 1978</strong>
B23 is secretly entered into the 22nd Annual Long Walk.
As boosted-boys tend to do, he laughed at the other idiot-walkers when they got their tickets.
Such second-class specimens, he thought. He walked at a steady 4.1 mph thanks to his muscle implants
which helped average out his gait.

<strong>May 4, 1978: Deadly Peanut-butter</strong>
The morning of day 4, he got his foodbelt and canteen,
and was trailing behind a group of boys. He liked to listen to their conversation to avoid the
long boredom, but he kept his distance. He was trained not to make friends.
They were on 126 heading into Freeport and the crowds were getting dense.
Suddenly, a spectator threw some fireworks into the pack of boys and all hell broke loose.
The flaming-balls that were supposed to shoot straight up, were now shooting
in all directions. Some fireworks were also set off in the crowd and chaos ensued.
Spectators ran past the barriers trying to escape the fireballs and were ticketed.
Walkers ran off the road and were ticketed.

B23 was far enough back to enjoy this entertaining show of stupidity.
He thought it was the most fucking hilarious thing he'd ever seen and
laughed the hardest he's ever laughed. After fully exhaling and nearly passing out
he inhaled hard and quick, but instead of air, he inhaled the large mound of crackers and peanut butter he had been eating.
Total blockage. He stopped in his tracks. His body was screaming for air since he had just exhaled.
There was nothing left to exhale to expel the block. His face turned bright red.
He was trained to be calm in the face of death.
"Use your mind! Think your way out of this!" he thought to himself.
He looked around for a way to give himself the Heimlich Maneuver since he knew nobody else would.
He ran over the barrier and attempted self-abdominal thrusts.
He tried falling on his back to impact his collapsed lungs.
During his struggle, his timer counted down past his first and second warnings.
He was coming up on this third, but the soldiers were too busy giving tickets to give warnings.
He passed out after 180 seconds, just 20 seconds short of his timer reaching 0.
The soldiers didn't give him his ticket until 5 minutes later.
They were too busy dealing with the panic in the main group to even notice.

<strong>Aug 1, 1978:</strong>
B24 commits suicide the morning he was due to get his implants.
Just like Stebbins, he has the shine ability to read fragments of thoughts when a person is sleeping.
Just like Stebbins, he digs through his step-father's private paperwork and learns the truth about The Major,
his half-brothers, and how eight of them were entered into the Long Walk, and all got tickets.
His step-father told him that he had a 100% chance of winning. How could that be true when they all died?
Rather than face the surgical procedures, followed by six months of painful rehab, followed by getting his ticket,
he decided to take control of his own death and end his life with his step-father's gun.

B25, Stebbins, age 16, was scheduled for the 24th Annual Long Walk in '80 at age 18,
but the Major, now 54 years old, decided Stebbins would take B24's place for the 23rd Annual Long Walk in '79.
Stebbins begins the four surgical procedures that will take many months to heal in painful rehab,
giving him muscle implants in his legs, hip, back, neck, and shoulders.
Although Stebbins has never met his real father, The Major, he holds a lot anger toward him.
Even through the anger, he still wanted to connect with him, and begins to think about his prize.

<strong>Apr 1, 1979:</strong>
Stebbins, age 17, during the 23rd Annual Long Walk Lottery is 172nd out of the drum.
The Major has gotten good at pulling off this magic trick where he palms the paper that he appears to fish randomly out of the drum.
Of the 40,000 that passed the physical and mental test, the smartest, most mentally-stable, and children of wealthy families,
were all removed from the lottery, so the remaining were the poorest, mentally-unstable, and the boys least contributing to society.
They would be strong physically as determined by the physical test, but the mental test and essay were about finding the lowlifes of society,
boys that would make the world a better place, if they were not in it.
The Long Walk had evolved from a way to remember the horrors of war, to a way to purge society of undesirables, and a platform to "real-world" test
technologies that would allow soldiers to push themselves beyond human abilities. To say The Long Walk was unfair, was an understatement.
The other 99 boys didn't stand a chance with their second-class intellect, and second-class physical specimens compared to a "boosted-boy".
Boosted-boy was the Major's name for his surgically modified bastard sons. Stebbins was truly superior in every way.
He also had his father's libido but was given vas-deferens valves before puberty. They would remain closed until his 19th birthday,
when he would be given the code, so he could open and close his own vas-deferens valves, so no accidental pregnancies.
Stebbins knew that none of the other boosted-boys won the Long Walk, but he also knew their reasons and figured he could avoid
the same fate ... except of course acts of nature, like lightning and large groups of rebellious walkers.
He was in denial that his father knew of his existence. He reasoned that if his father knew about him, he would be with his father now.
How happy they would be once they could be a family again, he thought.

<strong>Apr 31, 1979:</strong>
Stebbins receives the call from the Department of The Long Walk at 9:00 am letting him know that he is Backup #1.
At 9:30 AM he gets a second call letting him know that a Prime-Walker has backed out, and he will be their backup.
Stebbins had his father buy him purple pants to wear with his mother's old green sweater because he loves to read comics
and The Hulk is his favorite character, mainly because The Hulk is everything he is not.
Stebbins is a light-weight skinny kid with very little muscle, who wishes he was like The Hulk.
This purple-green combo is like his Halloween costume. He doubts any of the other walkers will get it.

Stebbins and his step-father fly from Missouri to the Presque Isle airport, rent a car, then drive up to the start in Van Buren, ME,
and get a motel room for the night.
