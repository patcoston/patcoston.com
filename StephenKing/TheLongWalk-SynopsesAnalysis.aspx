<h2>Synopses Analysis for The Long Walk</h2>

<p><strong>Every synopsis I've seen has mistakes.</strong> It's difficult to write a short synopsis that will interest people in reading this book, and still be accurate.</p>

<div class="container">

<p><strong>Here is my 100% accurate short synopsis: </strong>In an alternate reality set in the 1970s,
100 males from age 13 to 18, meet once a year for the Long Walk.
They walk until there is a single survivor.
Each teenager has a two-minute timer that counts down when they fall below 4 mph.
Once their timer reaches zero, they are shot dead by the soldiers who follow them.
The final survivor gets anything they want for the rest of their lives, and a large sum of money.

<li>The novel takes place in an alternate future, where a despotic and totalitarian American government arranges an annual walking contest. 100 boys set out walking from Van Buren, Maine and must continue to walk at a speed of four miles an hour until all but one stops walking. The rub? Walkers who stop are shot dead on the spot. The last man standing has his every desire taken care of by the government for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>100 teenage boys are picked from a televised draft lottery by a despotic alternate-history version of the US army, and told to walk until they stop. If they drop below four miles an hour they get a warning. Three warnings and they're shot dead. Of the 100 who start the walk, only one survives, and he is granted the ultimate prize: anything he wants for the rest of his life.</li>
<li>Set in a dystopian world run by totalitarianism, 100 boys meet for an annual race that has no definitive endpoint. The winner - that is, the last boy standing - gets a Prize at the very end, whatever his heart desires. Ostensibly, all these boys have to do is walk, but there's a catch or several given the strict rules that the contestants, called "Walkers," must follow. Specifically, the story tracks Raymond Garraty, a 16-year-old Walker, and the other teenagers that come in and out of his periphery as they quite literally walk to their demise.</li>
<li>the book is about a grisly, murderous marathon sponsored by a dystopian government, which sees 100 young men begin walking from the Maine-Canada border at a steady pace of 5 kilometers per hour. The last man/boy who can keep his body walking is given the prize of his choice, for the rest of his life; the other 99 are given a ticket, which is the book's cheerfully euphemistic way of saying that they're gunned down by a waiting truck of dead-eyed soldiers.</li>
