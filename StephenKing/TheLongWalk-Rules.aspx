<h2>The Definitive Guide to the Rules of The Long Walk</h2>
<h3>The actual rules are more complicated than most people realize</h3>
<h4>The book emphasizes <a href="TheLongWalk-Warnings.aspx">warnings</a>, but it's really about the <a href="TheLongWalk-Timer.aspx">2-minute timer</a>.</h4>

They can call an

    <span class="tiptext" style="width:400px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        After a while she knew I couldn't say Yes, okay, I'll call the 800 number.

        Excerpt:<br>
        I let the April 15th backout date go by
    </span>
</span>, the first of two backout dates, but they won't know if they would have been a Backup or Prime-Walker.<br>
They are called on the morning of
<span class="tooltip">April 31
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:620px">
        Excerpts:<br>
        Jan said she'd go all the way with me, any time, any way, as often as I wanted if I'd take the April 31st backout.
    </span>
</span>
and 100 are told they are Backups and 100 are told they are Prime-Walkers.<br>
If they decide to backout, they must call the 800 number before midnight May 1st.<br>
When a Backup backs-out, nothing happens.<br>
When a Prime Walker backs out,
<span class="tooltip">a backup is called
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:400px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        Twelve of the original Walkers used the April 31st backout. I was number twelve, backup. I got the call just past 11 PM four days ago.
    </span>
</span> to replace them.<br>
A Backup who replaces a Prime-Walker still has the option to backout.<br>
Backups and Prime-Walkers can backout on
<span class="tooltip">April 31
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:620px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        Jan said she'd go all the way with me, any time, any way, as often as I wanted if I'd take the April 31st backout.
    </span>
</span>, the second and last backout date.<br>
When a prime-walker backs out, a backup takes their place. The book is not clear on how they decide which backup to choose.<br>
I assume a backup is chosen at random, but they might go in the order they were chosen from the lottery.<br>
The next day, on
<span class="tooltip">May 1
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:300px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        I got the call just past 11 PM<br>

    </span>
</span>, all Prime-Walkers and Backups that have not backed out, show up to the start by 8:00 am.<br>
If they do not backout by midnight May 1, and are not on the lineup when it starts at 9:00 am, they get
<span class="tooltip">squaded
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:235px">
        Excerpt: But they Squad them just as fast for trying to back out of a Long Walk
    </span>
</span>, regardless if they are a Backup or Prime-Walker.<br>
Garraty implies to his mom that if you try to backout after the last backout date,
<span class="tooltip">she knows what would happen
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:320px">
        Excerpt:<br>

</span>
 (Garraty would get squaded).<br>
The Prime-Walkers are assigned numbers from
<span class="tooltip">1 to 100 alphabetically by surname
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:520px">
        Excerpts:<br>
        When I call your name, please step forward and take your number.<br>
        Then go back to your place until it is time to begin. Do this smartly, please.<br>
        Aaronson / took his large plastic 1.<br>

        Garraty: number 47<br>
        Peter McVries was 61.<br>
        Hank Olson was 70.<br>
        Scramm, 85<br>
        Stebbins was 88.<br>
        A boy named Tressler, 92<br>
        Number 100 / His name was Zuck.<br>
    </span>
</span>.<br>
We learn that McVries #61 was backup 12. The reason his surname falls alphabetically between Larson #60 and Olson #70<br>
is because the walkers numbers are not assigned until the day of the walk, once they know who is actually in the walk.<br>
The backups who did not replace prime-walkers
<span class="tooltip">can leave once roll-call is done
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:500px">

The loudhailer on the halftrack announces a warning which includes the walkers number, if a walker's timer reaches one of three thresholds.<br>
Timer counts down to 90 seconds, they will hear
<span class="tooltip">"Warning! Warning 47!"

Timer counts down to 30 seconds, they will hear
<span class="tooltip">"Warning! Warning 47! Third warning, 47!"

        His lips moved soundlessly as he counted down the last few seconds.
    </span>
</span><br>

Timer is under 15 seconds and walker speed in the correct direction is under 4 mph,

        Excerpt:<br>
        His lips moved soundlessly as he counted down the last few seconds.<br>

<span class="tooltip">ticket

        Excerpt:<br>
        they gave him his ticket after thirty seconds because he was walking with three.
    </span>
</span>.<br>
<p><strong>Type of warnings:</strong></p>
There are two types of warnings. The first type already mentioned is a courtesy-warning to let the walker know that their timer is counting down.<br>
The second type of warning is a
<span class="tooltip">penalty-warning
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:550px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        Rank took a swing at him&mdash;something expressly forbidden by the rules&mdash;and was warned for it.

A penalty-warning causes the walker's timer to
<span class="tooltip">instantly drop

        Excerpt:<br>
        Rank suddenly turned around and charged Barkovitch<br>

</span>
to the next warning-threshold or ticket.<br>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If their timer is at 120 (no warnings), it drops to 90 (first warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 91 (no warnings), it drops to 90 (first warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 90 (have first warning), it drops to 60 (second warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 61 (have first warning), it drops to 60 (second warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 60 (have second warning), it drops to 30 (third warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 31 (have second warning), it drops to 30 (third warning)</li>
<li>If their timer is at 30 (have third warning), it drops to 0 (ticket)</li>

A walker gets one warning removed for

        Excerpt:<br>
        you walk an hour without getting a fresh warning, you lose one of the old ones.
    </span>
</span> they do not get a warning since their last warning.<br>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
If they have 3 warnings, their timer is reset 60, which is
<span class="tooltip">equivalent to 2 warnings
    <span class="tiptext" style="width:400px">
        Excerpt:<br>
        He lost one of his three warnings and gained it back five minutes later.
    </span>
</span>.<br>
If they have 2 warnings, their timer is reset to 90, which is equivalent to 1 warning.<br>
If they have 1 warning,  their timer is reset to 120, which is equivalent to 0 warnings.<br>
If they have 0 warnings, their timer is reset to 120, if their timer was less than 120.<br>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The book is not clear on what happens to their 2-minute timer when they lose a warning.<br>
One possibility is that they get 30 seconds added to their timer up to 120 seconds, but I don't think this is the case because of this exceprt.<br>
<strong><em>But if you had three warnings and could manage to walk for three hours, you were back in the sun again.</em></strong><br>
I interpret the expression <strong><em>back in the sun again</em></strong> as meaning they have 30 seconds to get that warning back.<br>
IF they only gained 30 seconds when their timer was 1, their timer would be 31 when they lost their 3rd warning, and they'd be 1 second from their 3rd warning again.<br>
That IS NOT <strong><em>back in the sun again</em></strong><br>
