<h2>YouTube Video Reviews of The Long Walk</h2>

<strong>NOTE 1:</strong> The first <a href="">synopses</a> I read all had mistakes, but it got me interested in reading it.<br>

			200 are chosen in the lottery, but they have two opportunities to backout.<br>

			44:27 22. Garraty abruptly stops the story<br>

			1. It's not the <a href="TheLongWalk-NearFuture.aspx">future</a>. it's an <a href="TheLongWalk-Reality.aspx">alternate reality</a><br>
			2. 51 states. Excerpt "the most fucked-up state in the fifty-one"<br>
			3. Some, like Barkovitch, try to get others killed<br>
			4. They can go any speed they want. The Vanguard walks faster than 4 mph. If you tried to walk at exactly 4 mph<br>
			you would keep falling under 4 mph and your 2-minute timer would keep dropping. It is impossible for humans to walk at a specific speed<br>
			5. Their 2-minute timer counts down if they fall under 4 mph. A good strategy would be to sit down and rest for nearly 2 minutes,<br>
			then walk over 4 mph for 3 hours to remove your 3 warnings, then repeat<br>
			6. They get warnings when their timer counts down to 90, 60 or 30.<br>
			7. They are shot dead when their 2-minute timer reaches 0<br>
			8. There's no firing squad. Just soldiers. They can be shot by any number of soldiers. Sometimes just one.<br>
			9. Barkovitch<br>
			10. Larson said "I'm just resting. A guy can't walk all the time. Not all the time. Can he, fellas?"<br>
			11. Scramm said "Vegas odds made me the favorite just before the Walk started, Odds-on."<br>
			Stebbins had 9-to-1 odds. McVries said "Stebbins, Ray. Nothing can wear him down, he's like diamonds.<br>
			"The word is Vegas likes him nine-to-one now that Scramm's out of it."<br>
			12. Rank got himself killed by losing his temper. All Barkovitch did was insult him.<br>
			13. You're making an assumption based on what he said before. We don't really know why McVries sat down.<br>
			Perhaps he was in love with Garraty and decided to sacrafice his life for Garraty.<br>
			14. You're making an assumption. In my opinion, he would have never given up, and<br>
			tore out his own throat because his mind snapped and he went insane<br>
			15. It just says "He was skinny and blond". It does not say short or sickly looking. Barkovitch was short.<br>
			16. Garraty didn't consciously think this. It was a dream. Stebbins can read minds, so he knew about the dream, which is why he teased Garraty later.<br>
			17. Nothing came before The Long Walk. It's the first novel he wrote.<br>
			18. We don't know anything about the Major. Garraty's father said "the Major the rarest and most dangerous monster any nation can produce"<br>
			but that's heresay. The walkers need someone to blame, because they are not mature enough to take responsibility for their actions.<br>
			They volunteered for this. They had two chances to backout. They should be angry at themselves, but their too immature.<br>
			19. None of their family lives in those houses. Only their roommates.<br>
			20. It was only Garraty, and he only thought it, he didn't say it.<br>
			21. Baker was dead by this point<br>
			22. Garraty started falling asleep while telling the story and faded off. It was not abruptly ended.<br>
			23. King had not conceived of Richard Bachman when he wrote The Long Walk. So it's a young Stephen King ending.<br>
			If King had gotten it published, he might have gone on to focus on SciFi dystopian novels.<br>

			<strong>Abe:</strong> Garraty ... this is a bitch to say ...<br>
			<strong>Garraty:</strong> What's that?<br>
			<strong>Abe:</strong> It's a bitch. I just don't know how to say it.<br>
			<strong>Garraty:</strong> I guess you just say it.<br>

			<strong>Abe:</strong> What do you say? Yes or no?<br>
