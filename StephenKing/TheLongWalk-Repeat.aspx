<h2>Things that are repeated in other King novels, novellas and short-stories from The Long Walk</h2>

<p>The first novel that King completed was The Long Walk if you don't count <a href="StephenKing-TheAftermath.aspx">The Aftermath</a>. In some novels, King repeats about 50 things from The Long Walk</p>
