He howled and brought the knife down in a long, desperate stroke. Any closer and it would have torn off the tip of my nose. Then he landed spraddled awkwardly on wide-spread knees, with his face just above the mop-squeezing gadget hung on the side of the bucket. Perfect! I drove the mophead into the nape of his neck. The strings draggled down over the shoulders of his black jacket like a <strong>witch</strong>-wig. His face slammed into the squeegee. I bent, grabbed the handle with my free hand, and clamped it shut. Guy shrieked with pain, the sound muffled by the mop.</p>

She is survived by her husband, known to the staff of Neon Circus as Emasculated Toad, and one child, an ugly little fucker affectionately referred to by the staff as Pol Pot. Co-workers all agree that although she lacked even a vestige of talent, Jerri possessed a domineering and merciless personality that more than made up for it. Her braying voice was known to cause brain hemorrhages, and her lack of a sense of humor was legend. In lieu of flowers, Toad and Pot request that those who knew her express their joy at her demise by sending eucalyptus drops to the starving children of Africa.

The houses in the Bend were kissing cousins to woodsheds, but a gleaming TV aerial sprouted from nearly every one, and most of the TVs inside were color, bought on credit from Grant's or Sears. The yards of the shacks and trailers were usually full of kids, toys, pickup trucks, snowmobiles, and motorbikes. In some cases the trailers were well kept, but in most cases it seemed to be too much trouble. Dandelions and <strong>witch</strong> grass grew ankle-deep.

But Callahan seemed nice enough for a Pope-lover; his funerals were calm and comforting and always short.

He was pretty sure it was her, and that would mean putting on his parka, because Vera Winnick was in Rivington Two, and the walkway between here and there would be colder than a <strong>witch</strong>'s belt buckle. Or a well-digger's tit. Or whatever the saying was. Vera had been hanging by a thread for a week now, comatose, in and out of Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and this was exactly the sort of night the frail ones picked to go out on. Usually at 4 a.m. He checked his watch. Only 3:20, but that was close enough for government work.</p>

Me and Lisa McCandless were going to turn those fancy Persian rugs downstairs-you're supposed to do that every six months so they won't fade, or so they'll fade even, or some damned thing. I put my coat on and got it buttoned and was halfway to the door when I thought, What are you doin with this heavy fall coat on, you foolish thing? It's sixty-five degrees out there, at least, real Indian Summer weather. And this other voice come back and said, It won't be sixty-five out on the reach; it'll be more like fifty out there. Damp, too. And that's how I come to know I wasn't goin anywhere near the Strayhorn place that afternoon. I was gonna take the ferry across to Jonesport instead, and have it out with my daughter. I called Lisa, told her we'd have to do the rugs another day, and left for the ferry landin. I was just in time to catch the two-fifteen. If I'd missed it, I might've missed her, and who knows how different things might have turned out then?</p>

Things never do seem to change much on the island . . . if you only look at the top of things, that is. But there's lots more to a life than what a body can see on top, and for me, at least, the things underneath seemed completely different that fall. The way I saw things had changed, and I s'pose that was the biggest part of it. I'm not just talkin about that third eye now; by the time Little Pete's paper <strong>witch</strong> had been taken down and his pitchers of turkeys and Pilgrims had gone up, I was seein all I needed to with my two good natural eyes.</p>

I read that note over n over and I thought, Frig it-she ain't gonna end up like me, old n damn near used up at thirty-five. She ain't gonna do that even if I have to die to keep her from it.

<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 2656 675:This dogtrot, filled with light courtesy of its long glass ceiling, was lined with planters. At its far end, Wireman hung a right. I followed him into an enormous cool parlor. A row of windows gave on a side courtyard filled with flowers-my daughters could have named half of them, Pam all of them, but I could only name the asters, dayflowers, elderberry, and foxglove. Oh, and the rhododendron. There was plenty of that. Beyond the tangle, on a blue-tiled walk that presumably connected with the main courtyard, stalked a sharp-eyed heron. It looked both thoughtful and grim, but I never saw a one on the ground that didn't look like a Puritan elder considering which <strong>witch</strong> to burn next.</p>

The husbands grunted, turned over, told their wives to go back to sleep and leave them alone.

It's not my fault. I told them it wasn't my fault . . . I told them . . . but that lady said I was a <strong>witch</strong> . . . she said . . ."

<p>"Novels\Green Mile, The.txt" 2198 450:There was a moment of utter stop then, a quiet so thick that the only sound was the sobbing whistle of Percy's breathing. What broke it was cackling laughter, so sudden and so completely its own mad thing that it was shocking. Wharton was my first thought, but it wasn't him. It was Delacroix, standing in the open door of his cell and pointing at Percy. The mouse was back on his shoulder, and Delacroix looked like a small but malevolent male <strong>witch</strong>, complete with imp.</p>

The woman propped up in that bed looked like a sick child got up as a Halloween <strong>witch</strong>. Her livid skin was a hanging dough of wrinkles. It was puckered up around the eye on the right side, as if she were trying to wink. That same side of her mouth turned down; one old yellow eyetooth hung out over her liverish lower lip. Her hair was a wild thin fog around her skull. The room stank of the stuff our bodies dispose of with such decorum when things are running right. The chamberpot by her bed was half full of some vile yellowish goo. We had come too late anyway, I thought, horrified. It had only been a matter of days since she had been recognizable-sick but still herself. Since then, the thing in her head must have moved with horrifying speed to consolidate its position. I didn't think even John Coffey could help her now.</p>

A moment later he and Lois passed under the arch and simply stood there, staring into Atropos's underground apartment.

<p>Novels\IT.txt 6382 817:Richie thought about it. The idea of ghosts gave his child's mind no trouble at all. He was sure there were such things. His parents were Methodists, and Richie went to church every Sunday and to Thursday-night Methodist Youth Fellowship meetings as well. He knew a great deal of the Bible already, and he knew the Bible believed in all sorts of weird stuff. According to the Bible, God Himself was at least one-third Ghost, and that was just the beginning. You could tell the Bible believed in demons, because Jesus threw a bunch of them out of this guy. Real chuckalicious ones, too. When Jesus asked the guy who had them what his name was, the demons answered and told Him to go join the Foreign Legion. Or something like that. The Bible believed in witches, or else why would it say "Thou shalt not suffer a <strong>witch</strong> to live"? Some of the stuff in the Bible was even better than the stuff in the horror comics. People getting boiled in oil or hanging themselves like Judas Iscariot; the story about how wicked King Ahaz fell off the tower and all the dogs came and licked up his blood; the mass baby-murders that had accompanied the births of both Moses and Jesus Christ; guys who came out of their graves or flew into the air; soldiers who witched down walls; prophets who saw the future and fought monsters. All of that was in the Bible and every word of it was true-so said Reverend Craig and so said Richie's folks and so said Richie. He was perfectly willing to credit the possibility of Bill's explanation; it was the logic which troubled him.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 11570 15:"No?" the <strong>witch</strong> asked, and grinned. Her claws scrabbled on the plate and she began to cram thin molasses cookies and delicate frosted slices of cake into her mouth with both hands. Her horrid teeth plunged and reared, plunged and reared; her fingernails, long and dirty, dug into the sweets; crumbs tumbled down the bony slab of her chin. Her breath was the smell of long-dead things burst wide open by the gases of their own decay. Her laugh was now a dead cackle. Her hair was thinner. Scaly scalp showed in patches.</p>

<p>Novels\IT.txt 11608 67:She looked back again and now her dead father was not wearing the <strong>witch</strong>'s black dress but the clown suit with the big orange buttons. There was a 1958-style coonskin cap, the kind popularized by Fess Parker in the Disney movie about Davy Crockett, perched on its head. In one hand it held a bunch of balloons. In the other it held the leg of a child like a chicken drumstick. Written on each balloon was the legend IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.</p>

Henry's face was a frozen <strong>witch</strong>-doctor's mask of hate and murder. His right hand was cocked at cheek-level, and even as Eddie's eyes widened and he began to draw in his first shocked breath, the hand pistoned forward, the switchblade glittering like silk.</p>

She got into the newspapers, too, those tabloids, because she was pretty and rich, but mostly because of her father. And being fallen-away. That's what they call it. She was a scandal to that church of his, wearing mini-skirts and going braless and all. Well, you know what those fundamentalists preach is straight out of the Old Testament, all that about the righteous being rewarded and sinners being punished even unto the seventh generation. And she did more than hit the party circuit down there in Green <strong>witch</strong> Village." Tina's eyes were now so huge they looked on the verge of tumbling from their sockets and rolling down her cheeks. "She quit the NRA and joined the American Atheist Society!"</p>
<p>Novels\Joyland.txt 3544 222:Wiggle-Waggle Village was sort of depopulated with no greenies to play the fairy-tale parts, but Fred and Lane had reactivated all the mechanicals: the magic beanstalk that shot out of the ground in a burst of steam; the <strong>witch</strong> cackling in front of the Candy House; the Mad Hatter's tea party; the nightcap-wearing wolf who lurked beneath one of the underpasses and sprang at the train as it passed. As we rounded the final turn, we passed three houses all kids know well-one of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks.</p>

When Willie heard that the Catholics meant to spend a night gamblin at the K of C Hall, he just about hit the roof with the top of his pointy little head. He paid for those DICE AND THE DEVIL fliers out of his own pocket, and Wanda Hemphill and her sewing circle buddies put em up everywhere.

It promises them an eternity of joy in the next life if they live according to the rules in this one, and many of them try, but even that's not enough. When the pain comes, they want miracles.

He had gone down to check the furnace and boiler-such checks had become a ritual with him since the snow had closed them in-and after satisfying himself that everything was going well he had wandered through the arch, screwed the lightbulb on, and had seated himself in an old and cobwebby camp chair he had found. He was leafing through the old records and papers, constantly wiping his mouth with his handkerchief as he did so. Confinement had leached his skin of its autumn tan, and as he sat hunched over the yellowed, crackling sheets, his reddish-blond hair tumbling untidily over his forehead, he looked slightly lunatic. He had found some odd things tucked in among the invoices, bills of lading, receipts. Disquieting things. A bloody strip of sheeting. A dismembered teddy bear that seemed to have been slashed to pieces. A crumpled sheet of violet ladies' stationery, a ghost of perfume still clinging to it beneath the musk of age, a note begun and left unfinished in faded blue ink: "Dearest Tommy, I can't think so well up here as I'd hoped, about us I mean, of course, who else? Ha. Ha. Things keep getting in the way. I've had strange dreams about things going bump in the night, can you believe that and" That was all. The note was dated June 27, 1934. He found a hand puppet that seemed to be either a <strong>witch</strong> or a warlock … something with long teeth and a pointy hat, at any rate. It had been improbably tucked between a bundle of natural-gas receipts and a bundle of receipts for Vichy water. And something that seemed to be a poem, scribbled on the back of a menu in dark pencil: "Medoc / are you here? / I've been sleepwalking again, my dear. / The plants are moving under the rug." No date on the menu, and no name on the poem, if it was a poem. Elusive, but fascinating. It seemed to him that these things were like pieces in a jigsaw, things that would eventually fit together if he could find the right linking pieces. And so he kept looking, jumping and wiping his lips every time the furnace roared into life behind him.</p>

(Maura wasn't sure what a spindle was, but it must be sharp.) After countless years, a kiss awakened the princess from her slumber. The other was the story of Hansel and Gretel.

<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6283 210:Stories were only stories, but the ones that survived over hundreds of years must contain nuggets of truth. The truth in these two could be: spells could be broken; witches could be destroyed. Popping off the <strong>witch</strong>-woman in A Wing might not wake up Kayleigh and all the other women in the world. On the other hand, it might. It really might. Even if it didn't, the woman named Evie had to have something to do with this plague. Why else would she be able to sleep and wake normally? How else could she know things she had no way of knowing?</p>
<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6285 292:Maura had been in prison for decades. She had done a lot of reading, and even made her way through the Bible. It had seemed like a fairly worthless stack of paper at the time, men creating laws and women begetting beget-me-nots, but she remembered a compelling line: Thou shalt not suffer a <strong>witch</strong> to live.</p>
<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6289 122:"I'll be back, honey," she said, patting Kayleigh's shoulder. "Unless she kills me, that is. If she's a real <strong>witch</strong>, I guess she might."</p>

<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6390 138:Evie stood at the barred door of the soft cell, gazing at Maura. And smiling. Maura had never seen such a beautiful smile in her life. A <strong>witch</strong>, maybe, but gorgeous. The <strong>witch</strong> put a hand through the bars and beckoned with one long and elegant finger. Maura rolled her cart onward.</p>

<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6402 117:Maura hustled for the soft cell, reaching around to the small of her back and whipping out the toothbrush shiv. The <strong>witch</strong>-woman still beckoned. She doesn't see what I got for her, Maura thought.</p>
<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6404 76:She drew her arm back along her hip, meaning to piston it forward into the <strong>witch</strong>-woman's midsection. Into her liver. Only those dark eyes first slowed her, then stopped her. It wasn't evil Maura saw in them, but chilly interest.</p>
<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 6414 73:Wettermore and Murphy were coming. There were only seconds to stick the <strong>witch</strong>-woman and end this plague. Only Maura didn't. The stranger's dark eyes held her fast and she found that she did not wish to struggle against that hold. They weren't eyes at all, Maura saw, but gaps, openings into a new darkness.</p>

It seemed like an awful lot of work, and it was hard to imagine persuading anyone to let her in looking as she did now (sort of like the Wicked <strong>witch</strong> of the West, only in jeans and a shell top), but after what they had seen up here, where that woman had reportedly made her first appearance . . .</p>

Then he, Frank, would take over. There would be no seventy-two hours, and he didn't care if Eve Black was a <strong>witch</strong>, a fairy princess, or the Red Queen of Wonderland. Everything he needed to know about Eve Black had been in that one short phone call.</p>

Angel weighed coming up behind him and plunging the key in the untrustworthy quack's jugular. She loved the idea. Unfortunately, she had made a promise to Evie not to kill anyone until daylight, and Angel was profoundly wary of crossing the <strong>witch</strong>.</p>

<p>"Novels\Stand, The.txt" 3045 520:What was important was that a regrettable incident had occurred. Starkey flashed back in time twenty-two years to 1968. He had been in the officers' club in San Diego when the news came about Calley and what had happened at Mei Lai Four. Starkey had been playing poker with four other men, two of whom now sat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The poker game had been forgotten, utterly forgotten, in a discussion of exactly what this was going to do to the military-not any one branch but the entire military-in the <strong>witch</strong>-hunt atmosphere of Washington's fourth estate. And one of their number, a man who could now dial directly to the miserable worm who had been masquerading as a Chief Executive since January 20, 1989, had laid his cards carefully down on the green felt table and he had said: Gentlemen, a regrettable incident has occurred. And when a regrettable incident occurs which involves any branch of the United States Military, we don't question the roots of that incident but rather how the branches may best be pruned. The service is mother and father to us. And if you find your mother raped or your father beaten and robbed, before you call the police or begin an investigation, you cover their nakedness. Because you love them.</p>

It's made me greatly disliked in my field. I have my faults; I talk too much, as you've heard, and I'm a terrible painter, as you've seen, and I used to be terribly unwise with money. I sometimes spent the last three days before payday eating peanut butter sandwiches and I was notorious in Woodsville for opening savings accounts and then closing them out a week later. But I never really let it get me down, Stu. Eccentric but cheerful, that's me. The only bane of my life has been my dreams. Ever since boyhood I've been plagued by amazingly vivid dreams. A lot of them have been nasty. As a youngster it was trolls under bridges that reached up and grabbed my foot or a <strong>witch</strong> that turned me into a bird … I would open my mouth to scream, and nothing but a string of caws would come out. Do you ever have bad dreams, Stu?"</p>

<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 14380 657:Gordon Sloat had been a dour Lutheran minister in Ohio-Morgan had spent his whole boyhood trying to flee that harsh and frightening man. Finally he had escaped to Yale. He had set his entire mind and spirit on Yale in his sophomore year of high school for one reason above all others, unadmitted by his conscious mind but as deep as bedrock: it was a place where his rude, rural father would never dare to come. If his father ever tried to set foot on the Yale campus, something would happen to him. Just what that something might be, the high-school-age Sloat was not sure . . . but it would be roughly akin, he felt, to what had happened to the Wicked <strong>witch</strong> when Dorothy threw the bucket of water over her. And this insight seemed to have been true: his father never had set foot on the Yale campus. From Morgan's first day there, Gordon Sloat's power over his son had begun to wane-that alone made all the striving and effort seem worthwhile.</p>

For a moment Gard forgot all his pain and weariness and sickness. He was held in thrall by that poisoned gaze. In that instant he understood all the truth and all the power of the fearsome woman Bobbi had called Sissy, and the reason Bobbi had fled from her, as from a fiend. She was a fiend. She was a <strong>witch</strong>. And even now, in her fearful agony, her hate held.</p>

He had already started drafting a list of executive orders, which he would begin putting into effect as soon as he was granted full executive powers. That would happen tonight.

Mr. Grace sounded like a very small child, helpless, hopeless. I had made him fuck himself with his own big tool, like one of those weird experiences you read about in the Penthouse Forum.

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower I The Gunslinger.txt" 43 837:Above, the stars were unwinking, also constant. Suns and worlds by the million. Dizzying constellations, cold fire in every primary hue. As he watched, the sky washed from violet to ebony. A meteor etched a brief, spectacular arc below Old Mother and winked out. The fire threw strange shadows as the devil-grass burned its slow way down into new patterns-not ideograms but a straightforward crisscross vaguely frightening in its own no-nonsense surety. He had laid his fuel in a pattern that was not artful but only workable. It spoke of blacks and whites. It spoke of a man who might straighten bad pictures in strange hotel rooms. The fire burned its steady, slow flame, and phantoms danced in its incandescent core. The gunslinger did not see. The two patterns, art and craft, were welded together as he slept. The wind moaned, a <strong>witch</strong> with cancer in her belly. Every now and then a perverse downdraft would make the smoke whirl and puff toward him and he breathed some of it in. It built dreams in the same way that a small irritant may build a pearl in an oyster. The gunslinger occasionally moaned with the wind. The stars were as indifferent to this as they were to wars, crucifixions, resurrections. This also would have pleased him.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower I The Gunslinger.txt" 1255 408:His reaction was automatic, instantaneous, inbred. He whirled on his heels while his hands pulled the guns from their holsters, the butts heavy and sure in his hands. It was Allie, and of course it had to be Allie, coming at him with her face distorted, the scar a hellish purple in the lowering light. He saw that she was held hostage; the distorted, grimacing face of Sheb peered over her shoulder like a <strong>witch</strong>'s familiar. She was his shield and sacrifice. He saw it all, clear and shadowless in the frozen, deathless light of the sterile calm, and heard her:</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower I The Gunslinger.txt" 2313 163:Then there was sawgrass: at first only yellow scrub, clinging with gruesome vitality to the bleak soil where the last of the runoff reached. Further up there was <strong>witch</strong>-grass, first sparse, then green and rank . . . then the sweet smell of real grass, mixed with timothy and shaded by the first of the dwarfed firs. There the gunslinger saw an arc of brown moving in the shadows. He drew, fired, and felled the rabbit all before Jake could begin to cry out his surprise.

Like Si and Mercy, they were all old, and one of them, a woman hobbling over a cane like a <strong>witch</strong> in a fairy-tale, looked positively ancient. As they neared, Jake realized that two of the men were identical twins. Long white hair spilled over the shoulders of their patched homespun shirts.

It was a smile guaranteed to make even a brave girl think of stories told in the nursery-Winter's tales of old women with snaggle teeth and bubbling cauldrons full of toad-green liquid. There was no cauldron over the fire in this room (nor was the fire itself much of a shake, in Susan's opinion), but the girl guessed there had been, betimes, and things in it of which it might be better not to think. That this woman was a real <strong>witch</strong> and not just an old lady posing as one was something Susan had felt sure of from the moment she had seen Rhea darting back inside her hut with the malformed cat at her heels.

Them she had heard approaching, and in plenty of time for her to leave the road and rest behind a handy piñón tree (she refused to think of it as hiding, exactly).

He was too busy strutting and preening (also too busy trying to look down the front of sai Delgado's dress at every opportunity) to know that people-his own Chancellor among them-were laughing at him behind his back. That might stop when the girl had returned to her aunt's with a big belly, but that wouldn't be for months yet. The <strong>witch</strong> had seen to that. It would be even longer if the girl kindled slowly. And what was the silliest, most humilating thing of all? That she, John Haverty's daughter Olive, still loved her husband. Hart was an overweening, vainglorious, prancing loon of a man, but she still loved him.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 4983 65:"Headache powder. Hangover powder, ye might say. From the old <strong>witch</strong>. The one who lives up the Coos. Know where I mean?" Avery gave Jonas a knowing look. The old gunny pretended not to see it, but Roland thought he had. And what did it mean? Another mystery.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 4989 37:"Aye, boy, but ye pay a price for <strong>witch</strong>'s medicine. Remember that: ye always pay. This 'un takes away the headache if ye drink too much of Mayor Thorin's damned punch, but it gripes the bowels somethin fierce, so it does. And the farts-!" He waved a hand in front of his face to demonstrate, took another sip from the cup, then set it aside. He returned to his former gravity, but the mood in the room had lightened just a little; they all felt it. "Now what are we to do about this business?"</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 5192 529:Aunt Cord had been at the stove, wrapped in her dressing gown and with her hair still netted. She dished herself up a bowl of oatmeal and brought it to the table. Susan had known things weren't good as soon as her aunt turned toward her, bowl in hand; she could see the discontented twitch of Aunt Cord's lips, and the disapproving glance she shot at the orange Susan was peeling. Her aunt was still rankled by the silver and gold she had expected to have in hand by now, coins which would be withheld yet awhile due to the <strong>witch</strong>'s prankish decree that Susan should remain a virgin until autumn.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 5354 138:Then Aunt Cord had smiled. A real smile. What hurt Susan the most, confused her the most, was that her aunt was no cradle-story ogre, no <strong>witch</strong> like Rhea of the Coos. There was no monster here, only a maiden lady with some few social pretensions, a love of gold and silver, and a fear of being turned out, penniless, into the world.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 6940 706:The second Reaping dress (which Susan thought of as Blue Dress With Beads; the first, her breakfast dress, was White Dress With High Waist and Puffed Sleeves) had been kept apart from the others-it needed a bit of work yet-and something had gotten into the first-floor sewing room and gnawed it pretty much to rags. If this had been the costume she was to wear to the bonfire-lighting, or the one she was to wear to the ballroom dance after the bonfire had been lit, the matter would indeed have been serious. But Blue Dress With Beads was essentially just a fancified day receiving dress, and could easily be replaced in the two months between now and the Reap. Only two! Once-on the night the old <strong>witch</strong> had granted her her reprieve-it had seemed like eons before she would have to begin her bed-service to Mayor Thorin. And now it was only two months! She twisted in a kind of involuntary protest at the thought.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 7034 247:"Balls to her and all witches!" His cultured politician's tones had been replaced by an accent as thick as that in the voice of any back-country farmhand from Onnie's Ford. "I must have something, a bonbon, aye, so I must. Balls to the <strong>witch</strong>, I say! Owlshit to 'er!" The smell of tobacco a thick reek around her head. She thought that she would vomit if she had to smell it much longer. "Just stand still, girl. Stand still, my temptation. Mind me well!"</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 7360 250:She and Rhea had gone to the door of the hut, Susan said, and there they had stood with the Kissing Moon shining down on their faces. The old woman had been touching her hair, Susan remembered that much. The touch revolted her, especially after the <strong>witch</strong>'s previous touches, but Susan had been unable to do anything about it. Arms too heavy to raise; tongue too heavy to speak. She could only stand there while the <strong>witch</strong> whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 7665 843:Roland and Susan were careful-as careful as delirious people could be, at any rate. They never met in the same place twice in a row, they never met at the same time twice in a row, they never skulked on their way to their trysts. In Hambry, riders were common but skulkers were noticed. Susan never tried to cover her "riding out" by enlisting the help of a friend (although she had friends who would have done her this service); people who needed alibis were people keeping secrets. She had a sense that Aunt Cord was growing increasingly uneasy about her rides-particularly the ones she took in the early evenings-but so far she accepted Susan's oft-repeated reason for them: she needed time to be solitary, to meditate on her promise and to accept her responsibility. Ironically, these suggestions had originally come from the <strong>witch</strong> of the Coos.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 9355 13:"From the <strong>witch</strong>," Roland mused. "Yes, but how did she know? For she never leaves the Coos, or so Susan has told me."</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 9357 204:"I can't say. Nor do I much care. What I'm most concerned about right now is making sure that Sheemie isn't hurt because of what he told me and gave me. After that, I'm concerned that what old <strong>witch</strong> Rhea has tried to tell once she doesn't try to tell again."</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 9726 234:"You won't bless anything if the Wizard's Rainbow gets hold of you," Latigo said grimly, and swung his attention back to Jonas. "You'll want to be even more careful taking it back than you were in giving it over. The old <strong>witch</strong>-woman's likely under its glam by now."</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 11462 170:He knew something, all right-how dangerous the smooth, glassy thing in his hands was. It could take him in a blink, if it wanted. And in a month, he would be like the <strong>witch</strong>: scrawny, raddled with sores, and too obsessed to know or care.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 11604 203:It took the riders longer to reach her position than she would have expected, and when they finally got there, she saw why. Rhea was with them, sitting in a black cart covered with magical symbols. The <strong>witch</strong> had been scary when Susan had seen her on the night of the Kissing Moon, but still recognizably human; what the girl saw passing before her now, rocking from side to side in the black cart and clutching a bag in her lap, was an unsexed, sore-raddled creature that looked more like a troll than a human being. With her were the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 11741 104:Sheemie, whose life had been saved by "Mr. Arthur Heath." Sheemie, who had risked the wrath of the <strong>witch</strong> by giving Cuthbert the note meant for her aunt. Sheemie, who had brought these barrels up here. They had been smeared with soot to partially camouflage them, and Susan got some on her hands and the sleeves of her shirt as she took off the tops-more ashes. But the firecrackers were still inside: the round, fist-sized big-bangers and the smaller lady-fingers.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 12577 37:"Good. Get about it. And tell the <strong>witch</strong> to put her toy back in its bag." Jonas passed a hand over his brow. Fingers which had rarely shaken before had now picked up a minute tremble. "It's distracting."</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 12772 119:"Well, perhaps, but you did quite well in the time you had, lady-sai. Few could have done better. And listen to the <strong>witch</strong> cackle! Like salt in his wounds, I wot . . . but we'll shut her up soon enough." Then, turning his head: "Clay!"</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 12886 138:Sheemie, crouched down in the grass and peering into the clearing, was nearly run over by Rhea's black wagon; the screaming, gibbering <strong>witch</strong> passed so close to him that he could smell her sour skin and dirty hair. If she had looked down, she couldn't have missed seeing him and undoubtedly would have turned him into a bird or a bumbler or maybe even a mosquito.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 13291 329:It was at this point, not long after the last toll of noon had faded into the cold air, that the batwing doors opened and two women came in. A good many knew the crone in the lead, and several of them crossed their eyes with their thumbs as a ward against her evil look. A murmur ran through the room. It was the Coos, the old <strong>witch</strong>-woman, and although her face was pocked with sores and her eyes sunk so deep in their sockets they could barely be seen, she gave off a peculiar sense of vitality. Her lips were red, as if she had been eating winterberries.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 13293 124:The woman behind her walked slowly and stiffly, with one hand pressed against her midsection. Her face was as white as the <strong>witch</strong>-woman's mouth was red.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 13882 44:The galloped-out pony that had brought the <strong>witch</strong> back to Hambry had been replaced by a fresh one, but it was the same black cart, the same golden cabalistic symbols, the same driver. Rhea sat with the reins in her claws, her head ticking from side to side like the head of a rusty old robot, grinning at Susan without humor. Grinning as a corpse grins.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 14235 275:But he knew better. Demon Moon had risen, he had seen its orange light shining on Cuthbert's face like delirium, and he knew better. In his head the lunatic buzz of the thinny, that rotting sore eating through the flesh of reality, joined with the lunatic laughter of the <strong>witch</strong>, and he knew better.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 14295 183:In Maerlyn's Rainbow he saw her-Susan, horse-drover's daughter, lovely girl at the window. He saw her standing in the back of a black cart decorated with gold symbols, the old <strong>witch</strong>'s cart. Reynolds rode behind her, holding the end of a rope that was noosed around her neck. The cart was rolling toward Green Heart, making its way with processional slowness. Hill Street was lined with people of whom the farmer with the lamb-slaughterer's eyes had been only the first-all those folk of Hambry and Mejis who had been deprived of their fair but were now given this ancient dark attraction in its stead: charyou tree, come, Reap, death for you, life for our crops.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 14642 25:"Did you ever see the <strong>witch</strong> again?" Jake asked.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 14833 27:"Only in the movie, the <strong>witch</strong> wasn't riding a broom," Jake said. "She was on her bike, the one with the basket on the back."</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower IV Wizard and Glass.txt" 15612 135:Jake turns for him, and is not surprised to see a green-faced woman in a pointed black hat swimming inside the ball. It is the Wicked <strong>witch</strong> of the East; it is also, he knows, Rhea of the Coos. She stares at the boy with the guns in his hands and bares her teeth at him in the most terrible grin Jake has ever seen in his life.</p>

Part of me hated her, too. But we both also loved her, and love her still. You were poisoned by the toy you brought back from Mejis, and you were tricked by the <strong>witch</strong>. One of those things alone might not have caused what happened, but the pink ball and the <strong>witch</strong> together . . . aye."</p>

She'd wanted to tell me because we were in love.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 678 110:Eddie passed at least an hour telling Roland the story of Hansel and Gretel, turning the wicked child-eating <strong>witch</strong> into Rhea of the Coos almost without thinking of it. When he got to the part about her trying to fatten the children up, he broke off and asked Roland: "Do you know this one? A version of this one?"</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 1000 236:He looked down at the sidewalk, suddenly sure he wouldn't have a shadow. They'd lost their shadows like the kids in one of the stories . . . one of the nineteen fairy tales . . . or was it maybe something newer, like The Lion, the <strong>witch</strong> and the Wardrobe or Peter Pan? One of what might be called the Modern Nineteen?</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 5564 589:"There was a drinking fountain in the alley beside Spencer's Drugs, the sort of thing no Public Health Office would have sanctioned a few years later, but back then there was one or two in every small town. I washed Barlow's blood off my face and neck there. Tried to wash it out of my hair, too. And then I went to St. Andrews, my church. I'd made up my mind to pray for a second chance. Not to the God of the theologians who believe that everything holy and unholy ultimately comes from inside us, but to the old God. The one who proclaimed to Moses that he should not suffer a <strong>witch</strong> to live and gave unto his own son the power to raise from the dead. A second chance is all I wanted. My life for that.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 14635 541:For a moment Tian's wife only stood there, processing this information. Then she did something that surprised a man who was not often surprised. She threw herself against him, pressing her body frankly to his, and covered his face with hungry, wet-lipped kisses. Roland bore this for a little bit, then held her away. The sickness was coming now. The feeling of uselessness. The sense that he would fight this battle or battles like it over and over for eternity, losing a finger to the lobstrosities here, perhaps an eye to a clever old <strong>witch</strong> there, and after each battle he would sense the Dark Tower a little farther away instead of a little closer. And all the time the dry twist would work its way in toward his heart.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 15058 296:"She's gone, ye great dick-led galoot!" cried Rhea of the Coos from the darkness. "Taken her labor elsewhere, ye ken! And I've no doubt that when her cannibal baby finally comes out, it'll munch its mother north from the cunt, aye!" She laughed, a perfect (and perfectly grating) <strong>witch</strong> Hazel cackle. "No titty-milk fer this one, ye grobbut lost lad! This one'll have meat!"</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower VII The Dark Tower.txt" 10393 716:The other painting showed the Dark Tower, a sooty-gray black cylinder tapering upward. It stood at the far end of Can'-Ka No Rey, the field of roses. In their dreams the Tower had seemed taller than the tallest skyscraper in New York (to Susannah this meant the Empire State Building). In the painting it looked to be no more than six hundred feet high, yet this robbed it of none of its dreamlike majesty. The narrow windows rose in an ascending spiral around it just as in their dreams. At the top was an oriel window of many colors-each, Roland knew, corresponding to one of the Wizard's glasses. The inmost circle but one was the pink of the ball that had been left for awhile in the keeping of a certain <strong>witch</strong>-woman named Rhea; the center was the dead ebony of Black Thirteen.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower VII The Dark Tower.txt" 13666 179:Susannah smiled and reached out to pat his knee. "Don't look like that, sugar. It's not your fault that you spent God knows how long caged up like Hansel and Gretel in the <strong>witch</strong>'s house."</p>
