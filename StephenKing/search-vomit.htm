<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\Apt Pupil.txt" 554 164:"Like the Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower-heads. And they . . . they began to leap about. Some were screaming. Most of them were laughing. They began to <strong>vomit</strong>, and to . . . to defecate helplessly."</p>
<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\Apt Pupil.txt" 1909 341:Cautiously, he bent down with his hands on his knees and peered under the mail platform. There was a wino lying up in there among the yellow weeds and empty cans and dusty old bottles. It was impossible to tell his age; Todd put him at somewhere between thirty and four hundred. He was wearing a strappy tee-shirt that was caked with dried <strong>vomit</strong>, green pants that were far too big for him, and gray leather workshoes cracked in a hundred places. The cracks gaped like agonized mouths. Todd thought he smelled like Dussander's cellar.</p>
<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\The Body.txt" 1728 64:Bill Travis blew a great-and seemingly supercharged-jet of <strong>vomit</strong> out over the first two rows of spectators, his stunned face proclaiming to one and all, Man, I just can't believe I'm doing this;</p>
<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\The Body.txt" 1738 1122:Lard Ass Hogan, now at the absolute apogee of his young life, beamed happily out over the audience. Puke was everywhere. People staggered around in drunken circles, holding their throats and making weak cawing noises. Somebody's pet Pekingese ran past the stage, yapping crazily, and a man wearing jeans and a Western-style silk shirt threw up on it, nearly drowning it. Mrs. Brockway, the Methodist minister's wife, made a long, basso belching noise which was followed by a gusher of degenerated roast beef and mashed potatoes and apple cobbler. The cobbler looked as if it might have been good when it first went down. Jerry Maling, who had come to see his pet mechanic walk away with all the marbles again, decided to get the righteous fuck out of this madhouse. He got about fifteen yards before tripping over a kid's little red wagon and realizing he had landed in a puddle of warm bile. Jerry tossed his cookies in his own lap and told folks later he only thanked Providence he had been wearing his coveralls. And Miss Norman, who taught Latin and English Fundamentals at the Gretna Consolidated High School, <strong>vomit</strong>ed into her own purse in an agony of propriety.</p>
<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\The Body.txt" 2355 635:That finally rammed it all the way home for me. The kid was dead. The kid wasn't sick, the kid wasn't sleeping. The kid wasn't going to get up in the morning anymore or get the runs from eating too many apples or catch poison ivy or wear out the eraser on the end of his Ticonderoga No. 2 during a hard math test. The kid was dead; stone dead. The kid was never going to go out bottling with his friends in the spring, gunnysack over his shoulder to pick up the returnables the retreating snow uncovered. The kid wasn't going to wake up at two o'clock a.m. on the morning of November 1st this year, run to the bathroom, and <strong>vomit</strong> up a big glurt of cheap Holloween candy. The kid wasn't going to pull a single girl's braid in home room. The kid wasn't going to give a bloody nose, or get one. The kid was can't, don't, won't, never, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't. He was the side of the battery where the terminal says neg. The fuse you have to put a penny in. The wastebasket by the teacher's desk, which always smells of wood-shavings from the sharpener and dead orange peels from lunch. The haunted house outside of town where the windows are crashed out, the NO TRESPASSING signs whipped away across the fields, the attic full of bats, the cellar full of rats. The kid was dead, mister, ma'am, young sir, little miss. I could go on all day and never get it right about the distance between his bare feet on the ground and his dirty Keds hanging in the bushes. It was thirty-plus inches, it was a googol of light-years. The kid was disconnected from his Keds beyond all hope of reconciliation. He was dead.</p>
<p>"Collections\Different Seasons\The Breathing Method.txt" 418 444:As with the generation of physicians following World War II, we were a bedrock-practical lot of sawbones, and the records of the major medical schools show a remarkably small number of washouts in the years 1919 to 1928. We were older, more experienced, steadier. Were we also wiser? I don't know . . . but we were certainly more cynical. There was none of this nonsense you read about in the popular medical novels, stuff about fainting or <strong>vomit</strong>ing at one's first autopsy. Not after Belleau Wood, where mamma rats sometimes raised whole litters of ratlings in the gas-exploded intestines of the soldiers left to rot in no man's land. We had gotten all our puking and passing out behind us.</p>
<p>"Collections\Everything's Eventual\In the Deathroom.txt" 352 607:Fletcher's fingers were still on the rheostat. He turned it all the way back to the left, then flicked the switch to OFF. The needles, which had swung all the way to the +50 marks on their little dials, immediately fell dead again. The moment the electricity left him, Heinz crashed to the gray tile floor, trailing smoke from his mouth as he went. The stylus fell free, and Fletcher saw there were little pieces of Heinz's lips on it. Fletcher's gorge gave a salty, burping lurch, and he closed his throat against it. He didn't have time to <strong>vomit</strong> over what he had done to Heinz; he might consider <strong>vomit</strong>ing at a later time. Still, he lingered a moment longer, leaning over to look at Heinz's smoking mouth and dislocated eyes. "How do you describe it?" he asked the corpse. "Now, while the experience is still fresh? What, nothing to say?"</p>
<p>"Collections\Everything's Eventual\Riding the Bullet.txt" 624 234:Two weeks after I graduated from college, my Ma had another stroke-just a little one. She tried to quit smoking again when the doctor scolded her, then put on fifty pounds and went back to the tobacco. "As a dog returneth to its <strong>vomit</strong>," the Bible says; I've always liked that one. I got a pretty good job in Portland on my first try-lucky, I guess-and started the work of convincing her to quit her own job. It was a tough sled at first. I might have given up in disgust, but I had a certain memory that kept me digging away at her Yankee defenses.</p>
<p>"Collections\Everything's Eventual\The Road Virus Heads North.txt" 16 253:Not, he supposed, that his critics would use that word. In an issue of Esquire last year, Bradley Simons had begun his review of Nightmare City this way: "Richard Kinnell, who writes like Jeffrey Dahmer cooks, has suffered a fresh bout of projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing. He has titled this most recent mass of ejecta Nightmare City."</p>
<p>"Collections\Everything's Eventual\The Road Virus Heads North.txt" 34 331:He liked that; liked the idea of a cannibal crossing the Tobin Bridge at sunset. In a Grand Am. He knew what most of the audience at the PEN panel discussion would have thought-Oh, yes, great picture for Rich Kinnell; he probably wants it for inspiration, a feather to tickle his tired old gorge into one more fit of projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing-but most of those folks were ignoramuses, at least as far as his work went, and what was more, they treasured their ignorance, cossetted it the way some people inexplicably treasured and cossetted those stupid, mean-spirited little dogs that yapped at visitors and sometimes bit the paperboy's ankles. He hadn't been attracted to this painting because he wrote horror stories; he wrote horror stories because he was attracted to things like this painting. His fans sent him stuff-pictures, mostly-and he threw most of them away, not because they were bad art but because they were tiresome and predictable. One fan from Omaha had sent him a little ceramic sculpture of a screaming, horrified monkey's head poking out of a refrigerator door, however, and that one he had kept. It was unskillfully executed, but there was an unexpected juxtaposition there that lit up his dials. This painting had some of the same quality, but it was even better. Much better.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Langoliers.txt" 4279 177:Albert stood over him, sobbing for breath, the weighted tablecloth dangling from one hand. Then he took two long, shambling steps toward the escalator, bowed deeply again, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed on the floor.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Langoliers.txt" 4396 240:Nick dropped the quarters back into his pocket and hurried to where the boy was standing with his hands propped above his knees like an old man who has badly overestimated his capacity for exercise. He could smell the high, sour stench of <strong>vomit</strong>. That and the sweaty stink of fear coming off the boy were smells with which he was all too familiar. He knew them from the Falklands, and even more intimately from Northern Ireland. He put his left arm around the boy's shoulders and Albert straightened very slowly.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Langoliers.txt" 5191 84:I guess they don't get live meat very often, she thought, and suddenly felt like <strong>vomit</strong>ing.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Library Policeman.txt" 3216 198:"I set off through the corn back toward Junction City. Usually those walks would sober me up a little, and I'd sweat out the worst of the hangover. Not that day, though. Twice I had to stop to <strong>vomit</strong>, and the second time I didn't think I was goin to be able to quit. I finally did, but I could see blood all over the corn I'd stopped to kneel in, and by the time I got back to town, my head was achin worse than ever and my vision was doubled. I thought I was dyin, but I still couldn't stop thinkin about what she'd said: Do whatever you want to her, but you make sure that the last thing you do is cut her throat.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Library Policeman.txt" 4140 412:He put the books on the console between the two bucket seats and took a package of red licorice out of his pocket. He tore it open and that old, sugary smell struck him at once, with the force of a hard slap. From his nose it seemed to go directly into his head, and from his head it plummeted into his stomach, which immediately cramped into a slick, hard fist. For one awful moment he thought he was going to <strong>vomit</strong> in his own lap. Apparently some things never changed.</p>
<p>"Collections\Four Past Midnight\The Sun Dog.txt" 2706 88:Ignoring him, Kevin went straight to the counter where Molly Durham stood. Her urge to <strong>vomit</strong> had passed off, and she felt much better. The whole thing seemed a little silly now, like a nightmare you have and then wake up from and after the initial relief you think: I was afraid of THAT? How could I ever have thought THAT was really happening to me, even in a dream?</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\1922.txt" 343 713:"That's no grave for a mum . . . muh . . ." He managed that much, and then fainted into the weedy scrub that grew behind the barn. Suddenly I was holding the dead weight of my murdered wife all by myself. I considered putting the grotesque bundle down-its wrappings now all askew and the slashed hand peeking out-long enough to revive him. I decided it would be more merciful to let him lie. I dragged her to the side of the well, put her down, and lifted up the wooden cap. As I leaned it against two of the stakes, the well exhaled into my face: a stench of stagnant water and rotting weeds. I fought with my gorge and lost. Holding onto two of the stakes to keep my balance, I bowed at the waist to <strong>vomit</strong> my supper and the little wine I had drunk. There was an echoing splash when it struck the murky water at the bottom. That splash, like thinking Ride 'em, Cowboy, has been within a hand's reach of my memory for the last eight years. I will wake up in the middle of the night with the echo in my mind and feel the splinters of the stakes dig into my palms as I clutch them, holding on for dear life.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\1922.txt" 351 206:There was nothing. I had imagined it. Surely I had. And so I tupped her down the well. I saw the quilt unravel from the end not held by the pillow-case, and then came the splash. A much bigger one than my <strong>vomit</strong> had made, but there was also a squelchy thud. I'd known the water down there wasn't deep, but had hoped it would be deep enough to cover her. That thud told me it wasn't.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\1922.txt" 1225 60:I crawled back from that awful pipe on all fours, spraying <strong>vomit</strong> first to my left and then to my right, and when my supper was all gone, I gagged up long strings of bile. Through watering eyes I saw that Achelois had gone back into her stall. That was good. At least I wasn't going to have to chase her through the corn and put a nose-halter on her to lead her back.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\1922.txt" 1229 171:When I'd taken what steps I could to prevent infection, I used the rags to wipe up my <strong>vomit</strong>. It was important to do a good job, for any farmer will tell you that human <strong>vomit</strong> attracts predators every bit as much as a garbage-hole that hasn't been adequately covered. Raccoons and woodchucks, of course, but mostly rats. Rats love human leavings.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\A Good Marriage.txt" 49 298:But all of that was just history, the stuff of obituaries, and they were still too young to be thinking of those. It ignored the minutiae of marriage, and such ordinary mysteries, she believed (firmly believed), were the stuff that validated the partnership. The time she had eaten bad shrimp and <strong>vomit</strong>ed all night long, sitting on the edge of the bed with her sweaty hair clinging to the nape of her neck and tears rolling down her flushed cheeks and Bob sitting beside her, patiently holding the basin and then taking it to the bathroom, where he emptied and rinsed it after each ejection-so the smell of it wouldn't make her even sicker, he said. He had been warming up the car to take her to the Emergency Room at six the next morning when the horrible nausea had finally begun to abate. He had called in sick at B, B & A; he'd also canceled a trip to White River so he could sit with her in case the sickness came back.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\A Good Marriage.txt" 405 501:Her belly clenched. She ran for the bathroom-still smelly in spite of the fan, usually you could ignore what a smelly business life was, but not always-and fell on her knees in front of the toilet, staring into the blue water with her mouth open. For a moment she thought the need to <strong>vomit</strong> was going to pass, then she thought of Stacey Moore with her black strangled face shoved into the corn and her buttocks covered with blood dried to the color of chocolate milk. That tipped her over and she <strong>vomit</strong>ed twice, hard enough to splash her face with Ty-D-Bol and a few flecks of her own effluvium.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\Big Driver.txt" 367 197:She was sitting on a rock and crying her eyes out. The filthy carpet-remnant was still around her shoulders. Her crotch ached and burned. The sour taste in her mouth suggested to her that she had <strong>vomit</strong>ed at some point between walking around the store and sitting on this rock, but she couldn't remember doing it. What she remembered-</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\Fair Extension.txt" 93 222:"That's the length of my extension?" Streeter contemplated the idea of fifteen years with wistful greed. It seemed like a very long time, especially when he stacked it next to what actually lay ahead: six months of <strong>vomit</strong>ing, increasing pain, coma, death. Plus an obituary that would undoubtedly include the phrase "after a long and courageous battle with cancer." Yada-yada, as they said on Seinfeld.</p>
<p>"Collections\Full Dark, No Stars\Fair Extension.txt" 367 12:"Are you <strong>vomit</strong>ing?"</p>

<p>"Collections\Hearts in Atlantis\Low Men in Yellow Coats.txt" 3325 311:Bobby wondered how in the hell Ted could think Carol was lucky. Her left arm didn't look just broken to him; it looked half torn off. He suddenly thought of a roast-chicken Sunday dinner, and the sound the drumstick made when you pulled it loose. His stomach knotted. For a moment he thought he was going to <strong>vomit</strong> up his breakfast and the day-old bread which had been his only lunch.</p>
<p>"Collections\Hearts in Atlantis\Why We're in Vietnam.txt" 125 759:She made no reply, but hey, when did she ever? She only sat there with her hands folded and her black eyes on him, a Halloween vision in green and orange and red. Old mamasan was like no ghost in a Hollywood movie, though; you couldn't see through her, she never changed her shape, never faded away. She wore a woven piece of twine on one scrawny yellow wrist like a junior-high-school kid's friendship bracelet. And although you could see every twist of the twine and every wrinkle on her ancient face, you couldn't smell her and the one time Sully tried to touch her she had disappeared on him. She was a ghost and his head was the haunted house she lived in. Only every now and then (usually without pain and always without warning), his head would <strong>vomit</strong> her out where he had to look at her.</p>
<p>"Collections\Hearts in Atlantis\Why We're in Vietnam.txt" 533 202:Sully walked toward her through the noisy hail of falling televisions and backyard pools and cartons of cigarettes and high-heeled shoes and a great big pole hairdryer and a pay telephone that hit and <strong>vomit</strong>ed a jackpot of quarters. He walked toward her with a feeling of relief, that feeling you get only when you are coming home.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 103 186:Curtis leaned to one side and ejected his breakfast. It wasn't getting rid of the food that interested him; he was many things, but bulimic wasn't one of them. It wasn't even the <strong>vomit</strong>ing part that he liked. What he liked was the gagging: that hard rejecting clench of the midsection, plus the accompanying yaw of the mouth and throat. The body was totally in gear, determined to oust the intruder.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 399 287:Then his weight returned and he crashed down on his back as the portable toilet hit the ground door-first. His teeth snapped shut on his tongue. The back of his head connected with the door and he saw stars. The lid of the toilet opened like a mouth. Brown-black fluid, thick as syrup, <strong>vomit</strong>ed out. A decomposing turd landed on his crotch. Curtis gave a cry of revulsion, batted it aside, then wiped his hand on his shirt, leaving a brown stain. A vile creek was spilling out of the gaping toilet seat. It ran down the side of the bench seat and pooled around his sneakers. A Reese's Peanut Butter Cup wrapper floated in it. Streamers of toilet paper hung out of the toilet's mouth. It looked like New Year's Eve in hell. This absolutely could not be happening. It was a nightmare left over from childhood.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 443 45:He did a sit-up-there was just room-and <strong>vomit</strong>ed between his spread knees, into the puddled water and floating strands of toilet paper. After his earlier adventures in regurgitation there wasn't much left but bile. He sat bent over and panting, hands behind him and braced against the door he was now sitting on, the shaving cut by his jawline throbbing and stinging. Then he heaved again, this time producing only a belch that sounded like the buzz of a cicada.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 445 73:And, oddly enough, he felt better. Somehow honest. That had been earned <strong>vomit</strong>ing. No fingers down the throat needed. As far as his dandruff went, who knew? Perhaps he could gift the world with a new treatment: the Aged Urine Rinse. He would be sure to check his scalp for improvement when he got out of here. If he got out of here.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 749 447:There was also a closet door standing ajar, but before checking it, Curtis opened the little fridge. Inside were four bottles of Zephyr spring water, one of them opened and three-quarters empty. Curtis seized one of the full bottles and drank the entire thing down. It was warm, but it tasted like the kind of water that might flow in the rivers of heaven. When it was gone, his stomach clenched. He rushed to the door, hung out by the jamb, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed the water back up to one side of the steps.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\A Very Tight Place.txt" 751 116:"Look, Ma, no gagging necessary!" he cried, with tears running down his filthy face. He supposed he could have <strong>vomit</strong>ed the water right onto the deserted trailer's floor, but he didn't want to be in the same room with his own waste. Not after what had happened.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\Ayana.txt" 21 468:I didn't say, "And may he stay down," but I thought it. Because he suffered. This was twenty-five years ago-1982-and suffering was still an accepted part of end-stage cancer. I remember reading ten or twelve years later that most cancer patients go out silently only because they're too weak to scream. That brought back memories of my father's sickroom so strong that I went into the bathroom and knelt in front of the toilet bowl, sure I was going to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\Mute.txt" 143 578:Monette hadn't spoken of her betrayal aloud. Kelsie still didn't know, although the bubble of her ignorance would pop soon. The straws were flying in the wind-he'd hung up on three different reporters before leaving on this trip-but there was nothing they could print or broadcast yet. That would change soon, but Monette would go on getting by with No comment for as long as possible, mostly to spare himself embarrassment. In the meantime, though, he was commenting plenty, and doing so brought a great, angry relief. In a way it was like singing in the shower. Or <strong>vomit</strong>ing there.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\N.txt" 369 744:I thought the effect the place had had on me would dissipate on the drive home-just a bad moment out in the woods, right?-and surely by the time I was in my own living room, with the lights and TV on, I'd be okay again. But I wasn't. If anything, that feeling of dislocation-of having touched some other universe that was inimical to ours-seemed to be stronger. The conviction remained that I'd seen a face-worse, the suggestion of some huge reptilian body-in that circle of stones. I felt . . . infected. Infected by the thoughts in my own head. I felt dangerous, too-as if I could summon that thing just by thinking about it too much. And it wouldn't be alone. That whole other cosmos would come spilling through, like <strong>vomit</strong> through the bottom of a wet paper bag.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\Rest Stop.txt" 99 157:The sound of another blow, and then a hoarse expectoration that was neither male nor female. Retching. Tomorrow, whoever cleaned these restrooms would find <strong>vomit</strong> drying on the floor and one of the tiled walls in the women's, but Lee and his wife or girlfriend would be long departed, and to the cleaner it would be just another mess to clean up, the story of the puke both unclear and uninteresting, and what was Dykstra supposed to do? Jesus, did he have the sack to go in there? If he didn't, Lee might finish beating her up and call it good, but if a stranger interfered-</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\Rest Stop.txt" 129 218:From the women's room there now came a series of thick hiccuping sounds, interspersed with low gagging noises. One of the stall doors banged. The woman knew that Lee meant it just as surely as Dykstra knew it. Just <strong>vomit</strong>ing again would likely be enough to set him off. He would go crazy on her and finish the job. And if they caught him? Second degree. No premeditation. He could be out in fifteen months and dating this one's kid sister.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\Rest Stop.txt" 287 214:He pulled over into the breakdown lane, threw the Jag's transmission into park, started to get out, and realized there wasn't time for that. So he just leaned out instead with the seat belt still fastened and <strong>vomit</strong>ed onto the pavement beside the driver's-side door. He was shaking all over. His teeth were chattering.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\The Cat from Hell.txt" 305 177:It rammed into his mouth, a furry projectile. He gagged on it. Its front claws pinwheeled, tattering his tongue like a piece of liver. His stomach recoiled and he <strong>vomit</strong>ed. The <strong>vomit</strong> ran down into his windpipe, clogging it, and he began to choke.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\The Things They Left Behind.txt" 29 558:My mother and sister had gone shopping in Portland and I supposedly had the house to myself until evening. I was reclining naked on my bed with a pair of my sister's underpants wrapped around my cock. The bed was scattered with pictures I'd clipped from magazines I'd found in the back of the garage-the previous owner's stash of Penthouse and Gallery magazines, very likely. I heard a car come crunching into the driveway. No mistaking the sound of that motor; it was my mother and sister. Peg had come down with some sort of flu bug and started <strong>vomit</strong>ing out the window. They'd gotten as far as Poland Springs and turned around.</p>
<p>"Collections\Just After Sunset\The Things They Left Behind.txt" 143 6:"I <strong>vomit</strong>ed," Warren told me that day in the Blarney Stone.

<p>"Collections\Night Shift\Night Surf.txt" 129 435:The stairs went up the side of the building, but I paused for just a minute to look in the broken window at the dusty wares inside that no one had cared enough about to loot-stacks of sweatshirts ("Anson Beach" and a picture of sky and waves printed on the front), glittering bracelets that would green the wrist on the second day, bright junk earrings, beachballs, dirty greeting cards, badly painted ceramic madonnas, plastic <strong>vomit</strong> (So realistic! Try it on your wife!), Fourth of July sparklers for a Fourth that never was, beach towels with a voluptuous girl in a bikini standing amid the names of a hundred famous resort areas, pennants (Souvenir of Anson Beach and Park), balloons, bathing suits. There was a snack bar up front with a big sign saying TRY OUR CLAM CAKE SPECIAL.</p>
<p>"Collections\Night Shift\The Lawnmower Man.txt" 91 62:That was when Harold Parkette leaned out the screen door and <strong>vomit</strong>ed into the zinnias.

The case was filled with novelty items-Chinese finger-pullers, Pepper Gum, Dr. Wacky's Sneezing Powder, cigarette loads (A Laff Riot! according to the package-Hogan guessed they were more likely a great way to get your teeth knocked out), X-ray glasses, plastic <strong>vomit</strong> (So Realistic!), joy-buzzers.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\Dedication.txt" 436 145:Martha nodded and began to speak again. Thirty seconds later Darcy bolted for the bathroom, where she struggled briefly with her gorge and then <strong>vomit</strong>ed up all the beer she'd drunk.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\Dedication.txt" 472 534:"But I didn't. I felt worse. I knelt down in front of the toilet and I did what you did, Darcy, only I did a lot more of it. I <strong>vomit</strong>ed until I thought I was going to pass out. I was crying and begging God to please forgive me, to let me stop puking before I lost the baby, if I really was quick with one. And then I remembered myself standing there in his bedroom with my fingers in my mouth, not even thinking about what I was doing-I tell you I could see myself doing it, as if I was looking at myself in a movie. And then I <strong>vomit</strong>ed again.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\Dolan's Cadillac.txt" 576 501:When all the asphalt pieces were down in the ditch, I drove the bucket-loader back down to the road equipment. I was getting low on fuel; it was time to siphon. I stopped at the van, got the hose . . . and found myself staring, hypnotized, at the big jerrican of water. I tossed the siphon away for the time being and crawled into the back of the van. I poured water over my face and neck and chest and screamed with pleasure. I knew that if I drank I would <strong>vomit</strong>, but I had to drink. So I did and I <strong>vomit</strong>ed, not getting up to do it but only turning my head to one side and then crab-crawling as far away from the mess as I could.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\Home Delivery.txt" 312 456:Goddam good thing, too, Dave Eamons said, because a few of the deaders almost got away. Old Frank Daggett, still two hours from the heart attack that would carry him off just as the excitement was dying down, organized the new men so they wouldn't shoot each other, either, and for the final ten minutes the Jenny boneyard sounded like Bull Run. By the end of the festivities, the powder smoke was so thick that some men choked on it. The sour smell of <strong>vomit</strong> was almost heavier than the smell of gunsmoke . . . it was sharper, too, and lingered longer.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\Home Delivery.txt" 358 322:Dave didn't know the secret because no one on Jenny knew. That was the way Maddie wanted it, and the way she intended to keep it. There had been a time when she had, perhaps, in the blue darkness of her shock, pretended to be coping. And then something happened that made her cope. Four days before the island cemetery <strong>vomit</strong>ed up its corpses, Maddie Pace was faced with a simple choice: cope or die.</p>

Two inches in, the drill hit metal.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 526 138:He drew a deep breath, and this was a mistake. He inhaled a great double lungful of Drain-Eze fumes. He was suddenly, violently sick. He <strong>vomit</strong>ed forcefully into the basin and then staggered away, still gagging and trying to retch.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 532 255:His gorge rose again. He half-knelt, half-swooned in front of the toilet, the bottle of Drain-Eze still held stiffly out in his right hand, and realized too late that Vi had put both the ring and the lid down this morning when she vacated the throne. He <strong>vomit</strong>ed all over the fuzzy pink toilet-seat cover and then fell forward into his own gloop in a dead faint.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 548 289:"No!" he screamed as the smoking Hydroxide Twins-Sodium and Potassium-ate through his nylon sock and sizzled his skin. He gave his foot a tremendous yank. For a moment the finger held-it was very strong-and then he pulled free. He crawled toward the door with a huge clump of <strong>vomit</strong>-loaded hair hanging in his eyes. As he crawled he tried to look back over his shoulder, but he could see nothing through his coagulated hair. Now his chest had unlocked and he gave voice to a series of barking, frightful screams.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 580 36:Howard raked his hands through his <strong>vomit</strong>-loaded hair and then flung them out in front of him in a curiously Gallic gesture-Et voilà! it seemed to say. Warm juice and shapeless gobbets splattered across Vi's white kitchen cabinets. Howard didn't even notice. The hideous finger had seized each of his ankles once, and they burned as if they were wearing circlets of fire. Howard didn't care about that, either. He seized the box containing the electric hedge-clippers. On the front, a smiling dad with a pipe parked in his gob was trimming the hedge in front of an estate-sized home.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 668 133:"The hell I will," Feeney said. He was looking into the kitchen, with its strew of implements on the floor and the splatters of <strong>vomit</strong> on the kitchen cabinets. His eyes were small and bright and interested. "The guy's my neighbor. And after all, I was the one who made the call."</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Moving Finger.txt" 754 54:The splash came again. It was heavier this time. The <strong>vomit</strong>ous toilet seat bumped sharply up and down. Officer O'Bannion got up, walked over, and bent down. Howard looked at him with some interest.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\The Night Flier.txt" 557 72:But although he could see all three of the bathroom's urinals in the <strong>vomit</strong>-splattered mirror, he could see no one at any of them.</p>
<p>"Collections\Nightmares & Dreamscapes\You Know They Got a Hell of a Band.txt" 640 187:"Please get us out of here, Clark," she said. "Please." Something tried to come up her throat and she clapped her hands over her mouth, sure she was going to upchuck. Instead of <strong>vomit</strong>ing, she uttered a loud belch that burned her throat like fire and tasted of the pie she had eaten in the Rock-a-Boogie.</p>
<p>"Collections\Skeleton Crew\Beachworld.txt" 312 260:The man who had been in the lead tossed him a nippled low-grav bottle. Shapiro upended it and sucked greedily, spilling crystal-cold water into his mouth, down his chin, in dribbles that darkened his tunic, which had bleached to the color of bone. He choked, <strong>vomit</strong>ed, then drank again.</p>
<p>"Collections\Skeleton Crew\Gramma.txt" 570 197:George backed out of the room, through the entry, and into the kitchen. He drew a long, shuddery breath and let it out. He wanted a wet rag for his nose, and suddenly he felt like he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. He went over to the sink and ran cold water. He bent and got a rag from the basin under the sink-a piece of one of Gramma's old diapers-and ran it under the cold tap, snuffling up blood as he did so. He soaked the old soft cotton diaper-square until his hand was numb, then turned off the tap and wrung it out.</p>
<p>"Collections\Skeleton Crew\The Monkey.txt" 414 430:With a groan, Hal dropped the monkey and backed away, fingernails digging into the flesh under his eyes, palms pressed to his mouth. He stumbled over something and nearly lost his balance (then he would have been right down on the floor with it, his bulging blue eyes looking into its glassy hazel ones). He scrambled toward the door, backed through it, slammed it, and leaned against it. Suddenly he bolted for the bathroom and <strong>vomit</strong>ed.</p>
<p>"Collections\Skeleton Crew\The Raft.txt" 240 520:Her struggles had weakened to the point where they were really no more than spasms. The blackness oozed over her-bigger now, Randy thought, it's bigger, no question about it-with mute, muscular power. He saw her hand beat at it; saw the hand become stuck, as if in molasses or on flypaper; saw it consumed. Now there was a sense of her form only, not in the water but in the black thing, not turning but being turned, the form becoming less recognizable, a white flash-bone, he thought sickly, and turned away, <strong>vomit</strong>ing helplessly over the side of the raft.</p>
<p>"Collections\The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\A Death.txt" 360 279:Barclay went back to the jail and sat in the cell Trusdale had occupied. He sat there for ten minutes. It was cold enough to see his breath. He knew what he was waiting for, and eventually it came. He picked up the small bucket that had held Trusdale's last drink of beer and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. Then he went into his office and stoked up the stove.</p>
<p>"Collections\The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\Obits.txt" 294 187:So far as I could tell, he had been murdered right around the time I finished writing his obit. I looked at my coffee. I raised the cup and sipped. It was cold. I rushed to the sink and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. Then I called Katie and told her I wouldn't be at the meeting, but would like to meet her later on.</p>
<p>"Collections\The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\Obits.txt" 648 210:I was breathing fast, and sweating all over. My balls had drawn up until they felt roughly the size of peach pits. I felt like fainting, also like <strong>vomit</strong>ing, and managed to do neither. Although I did plenty of <strong>vomit</strong>ing later. That went on for a week or more, and I lost ten pounds. (I told my worried mother it was the flu.)</p>
<p>"Novels\'Salem's Lot.txt" 7403 518:She boosted herself with a smooth flex of muscles, swung one leg over the sill, and then dropped to the dusty parlor floor and looked around. There was a smell. It oozed out of the walls in an almost visible miasma. She tried to tell herself it was only plaster rot, or the accumulated damp guano of all the animals that had nested behind those broken lathings-woodchucks, rats, perhaps even a raccoon or two. But it was more. The smell was deeper than animal-stink, more entrenched. It made her think of tears and <strong>vomit</strong> and blackness.</p>
<p>Novels\11_22_63.txt 3248 173:But no. Not everything, not yet. My stomach took another giddy heave just as my bowels went to work again. There was only one thing to do, and I did it: leaned forward and <strong>vomit</strong>ed into the sink.</p>
<p>Novels\11_22_63.txt 9862 101:Now I could smell something else that I remembered well from Christy's binges: the sharp aroma of <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>Novels\11_22_63.txt 9864 284:I ran down the short hall on the other side of the living room. There were two doors facing each other, one giving on her bedroom and the other leading to an office-study. The doors were shut, but the bathroom door at the end of the hall was open. The harsh fluorescent light showed <strong>vomit</strong> splattered on the ring of the toilet bowl. There was more on the pink tile floor and the rim of the bathtub. There was a bottle of pills standing beside the soapdish on the sink. The cap was off. I ran to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Novels\11_22_63.txt 13551 325:Malcolm Perry and the rest of the Parkland staff saved my life, I have no doubt about that. They also gave me an unintended and unwelcome gift that lasted well into my time at Eden Fallows. This was a secondary infection caused by the antibiotics being pumped into my system to beat the primary one. I have hazy memories of <strong>vomit</strong>ing and of spending what seemed like whole days with my ass on a bedpan. I remember thinking at one point I have to go to the Derry Drug and see Mr. Keene. I need Kaopectate. But who was Mr. Keene, and where was Derry?</p>
<p>"Novels\Bag of Bones.txt" 468 242:Sometimes I tried to write, and every time I did, I locked up. Once, when I tried to force a sentence or two (any sentence or two, just as long as they came fresh-baked out of my own head), I had to grab the wastebasket and <strong>vomit</strong> into it. I <strong>vomit</strong>ed until I thought it was going to kill me . . . and I did have to literally crawl away from the desk and the computer, pulling myself across the deep-pile rug on my hands and knees. By the time I got to the other side of the room, it was better. I could even look back over my shoulder at the VDT screen. I just couldn't get near it. Later that day, I approached it with my eyes shut and turned it off.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bag of Bones.txt" 651 240:When I staggered to my feet, I was at least able to breathe. My throat felt the size of a straw, and each inhale made a weird screaming sound, but I was breathing. I lurched into the bathroom and threw up in the basin with such force that <strong>vomit</strong> splashed the mirror. I grayed out and my knees buckled. This time it was my brow I struck, thunking it against the lip of the basin, and although the back of my head didn't bleed (there was a very respectable lump there by noon, though), my forehead did, a little. This latter bump also left a purple mark, which I of course lied about, telling folks who asked that I'd run into the bathroom door in the middle of the night, silly me, that'll teach a fella to get up at two A.M. without turning on a lamp.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bag of Bones.txt" 731 254:This time I didn't feel like laughing. This time I felt like screaming. Harold went on, happy and oblivious. Harold didn't know the bookberry tree had died. Harold didn't know the new Mike Noonan had cataclysmic shortness of breath and projectile-<strong>vomit</strong>ing fits every time he tried to write.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bag of Bones.txt" 3211 677:"I'd probably believe it myself, if I were on the other side. But I wonder if anyone notices that lucky Mattie is still living in a Modair trailer and can't afford health insurance. Or that her kid got most of her vaccinations from the County Nurse. My parents died when I was fifteen. I have a brother and a sister, but they're both a lot older and both out of state. My parents were drunks-not physically abusive, but there was plenty of the other kinds. It was like growing up in a . . . a roach motel. My dad was a pulper, my mom was a bourbon beautician whose one ambition was to own a Mary Kay pink Cadillac. He drowned in Kewadin Pond. She drowned in her own <strong>vomit</strong> about six months later. How do you like it so far?"</p>
<p>"Novels\Bag of Bones.txt" 8477 306:"I promise," she said. She was trembling in my arms, and great globular tears-the kind you expect to see in fairy-tale books, never in real life-rose in her eyes and went spilling down her cheeks. I could smell burning grass and charred beefsteak. For one terrible moment I thought I was going to <strong>vomit</strong>, and then I got it under control.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 2269 239:He pops his thumb up between her breasts like a hitchhiker, then says the magic word as he pulls sharply upward and backward. The magic word is Heimlich, and it works. Two more wads of paper fly from Judy's mouth, propelled by a jet of <strong>vomit</strong> that is little more than bile-her intake of food over the last twelve hours amounts to three cups of coffee and a cranberry muffin.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 3867 20:"You may have to <strong>vomit</strong>. If you feel you must, do it over there." Jack points to an overgrown track, even more ancient and ill-defined than the one leading in from the main road. This one seems to meander in the direction of Goltz's.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 7123 477:The uproar in the middle of his body can no longer be contained. Doc turns his head and <strong>vomit</strong>s as he races forward. It is not the first time he has puked while riding, but it is the messiest and the most painful. The weight of his bowling-ball head means that he cannot extend his neck, so <strong>vomit</strong> spatters against his right shoulder and right arm; and what comes leaping out of him feels alive and equipped with teeth and claws. He is not surprised to see blood mixed with the <strong>vomit</strong> erupting from his mouth. His stomach doubles in on itself with pain.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 7143 147:The red-hot iron bar seems to rupture his stomach, and Sonny has no choice; he lets the other bike fall and utters a groan and bends sideways and <strong>vomit</strong>s out what feels like every meal he has ever eaten. When nothing is left inside him, his stomach feels better, but John Henry has decided to drive giant rail spikes through his skull. His arms and legs are made of rubber. Sonny focuses on his bike. It seems to be standing still. He does not understand how he can go forward, but he watches a blood-spattered hand gun his bike and manages to stay upright when it takes off. Is that my blood? he wonders, and remembers two long red flags unfurling from the Kaiser's nose.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 8867 108:Mouse turns his head away from Jack, nestles it cozily in the hollow of his shoulder, opens his mouth, and <strong>vomit</strong>s. Bear Girl screams. The <strong>vomit</strong> is pus-yellow and speckled with moving black bits like the crud in the corners of Mouse's eyes. It is alive.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 8875 335:Beezer comes back with a huge bundle of rags, and he's put on a pair of green kitchen gloves. Not speaking, he mops up the pool of <strong>vomit</strong> between Mouse's shoulder and the backrest of the couch. The black specks have ceased moving, and that's good. To have not seen them moving in the first place would have been even better. The <strong>vomit</strong>, Jack notices with dismay, has eaten into the couch's worn fabric like acid.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 8949 347:Poking out of this spreading, vaguely leglike mess is a foot that looks remarkably undamaged. If I wanted to, I could pull it right off . . . just like a squash off a vine. The thought gets to him in a way the sight of the grievously wounded leg hasn't quite been able to, and for a moment Jack can only bow his head, gagging and trying not to <strong>vomit</strong> down the front of his shirt.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 10309 524:How much of this should he tell them? None of it, probably. But they must believe, and for that to happen he must use Mouse's word. He knows in his heart that he must be careful about using it-d'yamba is like a gun; you can only fire it so many times before it clicks empty-and he hates to use it here, so far from Black House, but he will. Because they must believe. If they don't, their brave quest to rescue Ty is apt to end with them all kneeling in Black House's front yard, noses bleeding, eyes bleeding, <strong>vomit</strong>ing and spitting teeth into the poison air. Jack can tell them that most of the poison comes from their own minds, but talk is cheap. They must believe.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 10361 548:"We're going to go now," Jack says. "Beez, you and Doc lead. We'll be right behind you in Dale's car. When you get to the lane and the NO TRESPASSING sign, don't go in. Just park your scoots. We'll go the rest of the way in the car, but first we're going to put a little of this under our noses." Jack holds up the squeeze bottle. It's a plastic version of Winnie-the-Pooh, grimy around the middle where Lester seizes it and squeezes it. "We might even dab some in our nostrils. A little sticky, but better than projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing."</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 10779 441:Instead, that guttural growl drifts out of the woods again, this time closer: GROO-OOOOO! And the trees whisper. Dale looks up at the house, watches it suddenly stack floors into a sky that has gone white and cold, and vertigo rolls through his head like a wave of warm grease. He has a faint sensation of Jack grabbing his elbow to steady him. A little help there, but not enough; French Landing's chief of police twists to the left and <strong>vomit</strong>s.</p>
<p>"Novels\Black House.txt" 10941 1078:The queen bee leads them, and the other bees follow in a swarm that discolors the air with its vastness and shivers through rooms that have been silent for centuries (for surely we understand-intuitively if not logically-that Black House existed long before Burny built its most recent node in French Landing). At one point the quartet descends a staircase of green glass. In the abyss below the steps, they see circling birds like vultures with the white, screaming faces of lost babies. In a long, narrow room like a Pullman car, living cartoons-two rabbits, a fox, and a stoned-looking frog wearing white gloves-sit around a table catching and eating what appear to be fleas. They are cartoons, 1940s-era black-and-white cartoons, and it hurts Jack's eyes to look at them because they are also real. The rabbit tips him a knowing wink as the Sawyer Gang goes by, and in the eye that doesn't close Jack sees flat murder. There is an empty salon filled with voices shouting in some foreign language that sounds like French but isn't. There is a room filled with <strong>vomit</strong>ous green jungle and lit by a sizzling tropical sun. Hanging from one of the trees is a vast cocoon that appears to hold a baby dragon still wrapped in its own wings. "That can't be a dragon," Doc Amberson says in a weirdly reasonable voice. "They either come from eggs or the teeth of other dragons. Maybe both." They walk down a long corridor that slowly rounds itself off, becomes a tunnel, and then drops them down a long and greasy slide as crazy percussion beats from unseen speakers. To Jack it sounds like Cozy Cole, or maybe Gene Krupa. The sides fall away, and for a moment they are sliding over a chasm that literally seems to have no bottom. "Steer with your hands and feet!" Beezer shouts. "If you don't want to go over the side, STEER!" They are finally spilled off in what Dale calls the Dirt Room. They struggle over vast piles of filth-smelling earth under a rusty tin ceiling festooned with bare light bulbs. Platoons of tiny greenish-white spiders school back and forth like fish. By the time they reach the far side, they're all panting and out of breath, their shoes muddy, their clothes filthy. There are three doors here. Their leader is buzzing and doing Immelmann turns in front of the one in the middle. "No way," Dale says. "I want to trade for what's behind the curtain."</p>
<p>Novels\Carrie.txt 1378 415:Now she blinked, and as she did so, a strange thing happened. The time it took to happen could have been no more than the doorway to a second, but afterward he had no trouble recalling it, as one does with dreams or the sensation of déjà vu. He felt a dizziness as if his mind was no longer controlling his body-the miserable, out-of-control feeling he associated with drinking too much and then coming to the <strong>vomit</strong>ing point.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 1492 276:He leaned forward suddenly, one small hand curled to his mouth. The movement startled Rafer, and the cat leaped down. Tom made three low, muscular urking sounds, and Clay steeled himself for the <strong>vomit</strong>ing that was almost sure to follow. He could only hope he wouldn't start <strong>vomit</strong>ing himself, but he thought he might. He knew he was close, only a feather-tickle away. Because he knew what Tom was talking about. The gunshot, then the wet, ropy splatter on the cement.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 1494 14:There was no <strong>vomit</strong>ing. Tom got control of himself and looked up, eyes watering. "I'm sorry," he said. "Shouldn't have gone there."</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 2163 256:She plunged out of the Coleman's glare and into the gloom of the Nickersons' living room, which adjoined the kitchen via a wide arch. Clay heard a soft thump as she went to her knees on the carpet, then more gagging. A pause, a gasp, and then she was <strong>vomit</strong>ing. He was almost relieved.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 2191 141:Clay began to gag. He turned his head and covered his mouth. He told himself he had to control himself. In the other room Alice had stopped <strong>vomit</strong>ing-in fact he could hear her and Tom talking together as they moved deeper into the house-and he didn't want to get her going again.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 3841 453:The five of them watched and waited at the living room window, but of course nothing came out of the smoldering wreckage, and there was no sound but the low crackle of fire eating deep into the Athletic Department offices and locker rooms even as it finished off the bleachers aboveground. The thousand or so phone-crazies who had been roosting there were, as Alice had said, crispy. The smell of them was rich and stick-in-your-throat awful. Clay had <strong>vomit</strong>ed once and knew the others had, as well-even the Head.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 5543 682:At quarter to three that morning, footsore and damp in spite of the hooded parka he had liberated from the caretaker's cottage in Springvale, Clay came to the intersection of Routes 11 and 160. There had been a major pileup at the crossroads, and the Corvette that had gone racing past him in North Shapleigh was now part of it. The driver hung out the severely compressed window on the left side, head down and arms dangling, and when Clay tried to lift the man's face to see if he was still alive, the top half of his body fell into the road, trailing a meaty coil of guts behind. Clay reeled away to a telephone pole, planted his suddenly hot forehead against the wood, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 5908 329:He had expected to come upon Ray with his pants loosened or actually around his ankles, but Ray was standing on a carpet of pine needles and his pants were buckled. There were no bushes at all where he was, not poison ivy or anything else. He was as pale as Alice had been when she plunged into the Nickersons' living room to <strong>vomit</strong>, his skin so white it looked dead. Only his eyes still had life. They burned in his face.</p>
<p>Novels\Cell.txt 6298 426:He turned and saw that Denise had gone down on all fours. Jordan was on all fours beside her and had one of her arms over his neck, but she was too heavy for him. Tom and Dan couldn't get forward enough to help. The corridor cutting through the mass of phoners was too narrow. Denise raised her head, and for a moment her eyes met Clay's. The look was one of dazed incomprehension, the eyes those of a slugged steer. She <strong>vomit</strong>ed a thin gruel onto the grass and her head dropped down again. Her hair fell around her face like a curtain.</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 2284 110:"In the end he turned her over and held her by her ankles. He punched her in the belly, hoping to make her <strong>vomit</strong>. I believe he would have tried to do a tracheotomy on her with his pocket-knife if he had even the slightest idea of how to go about it. But of course he did not. She died.</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 4919 429:He stopped. He was looking in through the hole in the driver's side window. A terrible low sound began to come from his chest, a jungle sound. She looked over his shoulder, saw, and suddenly felt a crazy need to laugh and scream and faint all at the same time. On the dashboard . . . she hadn't noticed at first; in the midst of the general destruction she hadn't noticed what was on the dashboard. And she wondered, with <strong>vomit</strong> suddenly rising in her throat, who could be so low, so completely low, as to do such a thing, to . . .</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 6073 251:He suddenly felt sick-puking-sick. Nausea fluttered sickeningly in his stomach and in the back of his throat. Arnie scrambled out of the car and ran for the head, his footfalls hammering crazily in his ears. He just made it. Everything came up; he <strong>vomit</strong>ed again and again until there was nothing left but sour spit. Lights danced in front of his eyes. His ears rang and the muscles in his gut throbbed tiredly.</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 7527 388:Roland D. LeBay rose from one of the camp chairs like the prow of a skeletal ghost-ship from Hades. He was grinning-and for the first time Arnie saw who had been sitting around him: Buddy Repperton, Richie Trelawney, Moochie Welch. Richie Trelawney was black and charred, most of his hair burned off. Blood had poured down Buddy Repperton's chin and had caked his shirt like hideous <strong>vomit</strong>. But Moochie Welch was the worst; Moochie Welch had been ripped open like a laundry bag. They were smiling. All of them were smiling.</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 7559 58:"I'm fine," Arnie said. Now he felt as if he might <strong>vomit</strong>. He snatched the pizza in its white box with the word GINO'S emblazoned across the top and fled into the cold sharp clarity of the night. The last of the clouds had blown away, and the stars twinkled like chipped diamonds. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, looking first at the stars and then at Christine, parked across the street, waiting faithfully.</p>
<p>Novels\Christine.txt 8924 19:"I'm going to <strong>vomit</strong>," she said in that same placid voice, and walked away. She moved jerkily now, like a puppet, all the dancer's grace I had seen in her shadow now gone. She walked out of the room slowly, but when she was out of sight the rhythm of her stride picked up; I heard the bathroom door thrown open, and then the sounds. I leaned back against the sofa and put my hands over my eyes.</p>

<p>Novels\Cujo.txt 505 166:That had been in Iowa City, Iowa. The following day there had been seven more cases. The day after, twenty-four. In all cases the parents of children afflicted with <strong>vomit</strong>ing or diarrhea had rushed the kids to the hospital, believing them to be suffering internal bleeding. After that, the cases had skyrocketed-first into the hundreds, then into the thousands. In none of these cases had the <strong>vomit</strong>ing and/or diarrhea been caused by the cereal, but that was generally overlooked in the growing furor.</p>

<p>Novels\Cujo.txt 661 208:She pulled free of him and got the washrag from its place, hung over the sink faucet. Her hands were trembling, her stomach was upset, and she was starting to get a headache. She thought that soon she would <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>Novels\Cujo.txt 2491 144:Joe picked the book up and then dropped it. The book thudded against the wall. His hands felt too heavy. His mouth was slimy with the taste of <strong>vomit</strong>. He got hold of the book again and opened it with a jerk that nearly tore off the cover. He could have dialed 0, or 555-1212, but in his shock he never thought of it.</p>
<p>Novels\Cujo.txt 3593 94:She locked her jaws against the scream the way she had locked her throat against the urge to <strong>vomit</strong> a few moments ago. She struggled with it, she fought it. And at last her heart began to slow down and she knew she had it licked.</p>
<p>Novels\Cujo.txt 3821 351:Jerry Garcia's voice, easy but somehow weary, came floating down the hall, magnified and distorted by someone's transistor radio until it sounded as if the vocal were floating down a long steel tube. Closer by, someone was moaning. That morning, when he went down to the smelly industrial bathroom to shave and shower, there had been a puddle of <strong>vomit</strong> in one of the urinals and a large quantity of dried blood in one of the washbasins.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dead Zone, The.txt" 917 71:"No, Johnny," Sarah said, although she was only holding back from <strong>vomit</strong>ing by an act of will now. "Get your money." Five hundred dollars was Johnny's salary for three weeks.</p>

The irises actually seemed to be in motion, turning and turning like pin-wheels. Looking at them made David feel nauseated, close to <strong>vomit</strong>ing, but he couldn't look away. "I may be a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them. I know a lot, Trooper. I do. I know a lot."</p>
<p>"Novels\Doctor Sleep.txt" 6918 164:The air escaped Dan's lungs in a shocked whoosh, and the breath he inhaled to replace it was rich with rot. He lunged out of the grave to his right, managing to <strong>vomit</strong> on the dirt they'd taken out of the hole instead of on the wasted remains of Bradley Trevor, whose only crime had been to be born with something a tribe of monsters wanted. And had stolen from him on the very wind of his dying shrieks.</p>
<p>"Novels\Doctor Sleep.txt" 7568 204:"We'll do that, too." But Crow dreaded the prospect. Any of them not sick when they got on the plane would be when they got off-equilibrium shot, hearing screwed blue for a month or more, palsy, <strong>vomit</strong>ing. And of course flying left a paper trail. Not good for passengers escorting a drugged and kidnapped little girl. Still: needs must when the devil drives.</p>
<p>"Novels\Doctor Sleep.txt" 10721 282:The motel had a breakfast buffet. Because his traveling companion was watching him, Dan made a point of eating some cereal and yogurt. Billy looked relieved. While he checked them out, Dan strolled to the lobby men's room. Once inside, he turned the lock, fell to his knees, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed up everything he'd eaten. The undigested cereal and yogurt floated in a red foam.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dolores Claiborne.txt" 1952 291:At last I couldn't stand it anymore. I took off my dress, put on a pair of jeans n a sweater (lockin the barn door after the hoss has been stolen, I guess you'd say), and grabbed the flashlight off the bathroom floor from beside the commode, where I'd dropped it when I knelt down to <strong>vomit</strong>. Then I went back out.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 1216 16:But instead of <strong>vomit</strong>, what came out of McCarthy was a long, low buzz-the sound of a factory machine which has been put under severe strain. McCarthy's eyes bulged from his face like glass marbles, and his cheeks were so taut that little crescents of shadow appeared under the corners of his eyes. It went on and on, a rumbling, rasping noise, and when it finally ceased, the genny out back seemed far too loud.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 1659 175:The woman abruptly pulled her hands out of Henry's and leaned forward, mouth opening. Henry stepped back, not wanting to be splattered when she let go . . . but instead of <strong>vomit</strong>ing she belched, the loudest one yet. Then, while still bent over, she broke wind again. The sound was like nothing Henry had ever heard before, and he would have sworn he'd heard everything on the wards in western Massachusetts. She kept her feet, though, breathing through her nose in big horselike snuffles of air.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 6108 119:Henry looks at him impatiently, but then he sees Pete isn't looking at Beaver but past him, at a steaming puddle of <strong>vomit</strong>. In it are kernels of last night's corn (Lamar Clarendon believes passionately in the virtues of canned food when it comes to camp cooking) and strings of last night's fried chicken. Henry's stomach takes a big unhappy lurch. And just as it starts to settle, Jonesy yarks. The sound is like a big liquid belch. The puke is brown.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 6122 142:Jonesy also drops to his knees, and now all three of them are surrounding the Beav, Henry and Pete to either side, Jonesy in front. There is <strong>vomit</strong> on Jonesy's chin. He reaches to wipe it away, but Beaver takes his hand before he can. The boys kneel beneath the maple, and suddenly they are all one. It is brief, this sense of union, but as vivid as their dream. It is the dream, but now they are all awake, the sensation is rational, and they cannot disbelieve.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 6999 98:After dark, while she was making him oatmeal (all but the blandest foods were now apt to set off <strong>vomit</strong>ing, another sign that the end was nearing), the whole nightmare started again. Terrified already by the increasingly strange news coming out of the Jefferson Tract, she had raced back to his room with her heart hammering. Duddits was sitting upright again, whipping his head from side to side in a child's gesture of negation. The nosebleed had re-started, and at each jerk of his head, scarlet drops flew. They spattered his pillowcase, his signed photograph of Austin Powers ("Groovy, baby!" was written across the bottom), and the bottles on the table: mouthwash, Compazine, Percocet, the multi-vitamins that seemed to do absolutely no good, the tall jar of lemon swabs.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 10046 808:As he drove west on I-90, past little towns (shitsplats, Jonesy thought them, but not without affection) like Westborough, Grafton, and Dorothy Pond (getting closer now, maybe forty miles to go), he looked for a place to put his new and uneasy consciousness where it wouldn't get him in trouble. He tried Jonesy's kids, then backed away-far too emotional. Tried Duddits again, but that was still a blank; Jonesy had stolen the memories. Finally he settled on Jonesy's work, which was teaching history, and his specialty, which was grue-somely fascinating. Between 1860 and 1865, it seemed, America had split in two, as byrus colonies did near the end of each growth cycle. There had been all sorts of causes, the chief of which had to do with "slavery," but again, this was like calling shit or <strong>vomit</strong> reprocessed food. "Slavery" meant nothing. "Right of secession" meant nothing. "Preserving the Union" meant nothing. Basically, they had just done what these creatures did best: they "got mad," which was really the same thing as "going mad" but more socially acceptable. Oh, but on such a scale!</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 10286 173:The person in the back of the Humvee leaned forward, seemed to say something to the driver, and the vehicle leaped backward, one rear wheel splashing through the puddle of <strong>vomit</strong> left by the store's last customer. It wheeled around on the road, paused for just a moment, then set off in the direction of Ware and the Quabbin.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 10316 234:It was the bacon. All they'd hoped to do was to make Mr. Gray stop for awhile; none of them had guessed how prodigious his gluttony would turn out to be. The effect on Jonesy's digestion had been fairly predictable. Mr. Gray had <strong>vomit</strong>ed once in the parking lot of the little store, and had had to pull over twice more on the road to Ware, leaning out the window and offloading several pounds of raw bacon with almost convulsive force.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 10391 621:Mr. Gray drove the Subaru nearly three miles up East Street-muddy, rutted, and now covered with three inches of fresh snow-before crashing into a fault caused by a plugged culvert. The Subaru had fought its way gamely through several mires north of the Goodnough Dike, and had bottomed out in one place hard enough to tear off the muffler and most of the exhaust pipe, but this latest break in the road was too much. The car went forward nose-first into the crack and lodged on the pipe, unmuffled engine blatting stridently. Jonesy's body was thrown forward and the seatbelt locked. His diaphragm clenched and he <strong>vomit</strong>ed helplessly onto the dashboard: nothing solid now, only bilious strings of saliva. For a moment the color ran out of the world and the rackety roar of the engine faded. He fought viciously for consciousness, afraid that if he passed out for even a moment, Jonesy might somehow be able to take control again.</p>
<p>Novels\Dreamcatcher.txt 10665 107:There was another click and the phone went dead. The body of his childhood phone cracked, split open, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed out a senseless tangle of wires. All of them were red-orange; all of them were contaminated with the byrus.</p>
<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 403 654:She went with her mother, casting one more look back over her shoulder and uttering one more bereft wail before starting up the steps to her house. I knelt beside Gandalf, holding onto the Hummer's fender and going down as I always did, painfully and listing severely to the left, trying to keep my right knee from bending any more than it absolutely had to. Still, I voiced my own little cry of pain, and I wondered if I'd be able to get up again without help. It might not be forthcoming from Mrs. Fevereau; she walked over to the lefthand side of the street with her legs stiff and wide apart, then bent at the waist as if bowing to royalty, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed in the gutter. She held the hand with the cigarette in it off to one side as she did it.</p>
<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 1562 50:"Daddy, I'm sorry but I think I'm going to <strong>vomit</strong>."</p>
<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 1572 190:seemed to be bleeding scarlet, I felt the tip of a pine-bough scrape across the wrist of-I could have sworn it-my right arm, and I thought I can do this, I MUST do this as I heard Ilse <strong>vomit</strong> again. I was aware that it was much hotter in that narrow lane than it should have been, even with the greenroof overhead. I had enough mind left in my mind to wonder what we'd been thinking, coming down this road in the first place. But of course it had seemed like nothing but a lark at the time.</p>
<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 1596 82:"I won't, Monica," I said, but at that moment she leaned out the window to <strong>vomit</strong> again and I don't think she heard me.</p>

<p>"Novels\Duma Key.txt" 10711 45:Jack fumbled open the door, leaned out, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. I'd thought the smell of the jungle (that's what it was once you were a mile past El Palacio) was strong in the car, but what came rolling in with the door open was ten times headier, thick and green and viciously alive. Yet I did not hear a single bird calling in that mass of junk foliage. The only sound was Jack losing his breakfast.</p>
<p>"Novels\End of Watch.txt" 1242 309:While he's rinsing the bowl, the pain on the left side of his abdomen returns, along with those tentacles curling around to his lower back. It seems to plunge up and down with every heartbeat. His stomach clenches. He thinks of running to the bathroom, but it's too late. He leans over the sink instead, <strong>vomit</strong>ing with his eyes closed. He keeps them that way as he fumbles for the faucet and turns it on full to rinse away the mess. He doesn't want to see what just came out of him, because he can taste a slime of blood in his mouth and throat.</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 107 443:Great banquets in the King's Hall were not very neat affairs, and most nannies wouldn't have been very concerned about the little boy's table manners. Why, he is to be the King! they would have said, a little shocked at the idea that they should correct him in such piddling matters. Who cares if he spills the gravy boat? Who cares if he dribbles on his ruff, or even wipes his hands on it? Did not King Alan in the old days sometimes <strong>vomit</strong> into his plate and then command his court jester to come nigh and "drink this nice hot soup"? Did not King John often bite the heads off live trout and then put the flopping bodies into the bodices of the serving girls' dresses? Will not this banquet end up, as most banquets do, with the participants throwing food across the table at each other?</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 167 732:"Yes. But there are few devils outside of made-up stories, Pete-most bad people are more like dogs than devils. Dogs are friendly but stupid, and that's the way most men and women are when they are drunk. When dogs are excited and confused, they may bite; when men are excited and confused, they may fight. Dogs are great pets because they are loyal, but if a pet is all a man is, he is a bad man, I think. Dogs can be brave, but they may also be cowards that will howl in the dark or run away from danger with their tails between their legs. A dog is just as eager to lick the hand of a bad master as he is to lick the hand of a good one, because dogs don't know the difference between good and bad. A dog will eat slops, <strong>vomit</strong> up the part his stomach can't stand, and then go back for more."</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 169 221:She fell silent for a moment, perhaps thinking of what was going on in the banqueting hall right now-men and women roaring with goodnatured drunken laughter, flinging food at each other, and sometimes turning aside to <strong>vomit</strong> casually on the floor beside their chairs. Roland was much the same, and sometimes this made her sad, but she did not hold it against him, nor did she tax him with it. It was his way. He might promise to reform in order to please her, and he might even do it, but he would not be the same man afterward.</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 619 222:"So it is . . . of course it is. At first I thought it was a canoe and this was some Oranian girl's washing." He tipped a wink at Flagg, who smiled vaguely at the air and said nothing. Thomas suddenly felt he might <strong>vomit</strong> quite soon.</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 775 1127:Flagg, one of the greatest magicians who ever lived, knew all the poisons that we know-arsenic; strychnine; the curare, which steals inward, paralyzing all the muscles and the heart last; nicotine; belladonna; nightshade; toadstool. He knew the poison venoms of a hundred snakes and spiders; the clear distillation of the clanah lily which smells like honey but kills its victims in screaming torments; Deadly Clawfoot which grows in the deepest shadows of the Dismal Swamp. Flagg did not know just dozens of poisons but dozens of dozens, each worse than the last. They were all neatly ranked on the shelves of an inner room where no servant ever went. They were in beakers, in phials, in little envelopes. Each deadly item was neatly marked. This was Flagg's chapel of screams-in-waiting-agony's antechamber, foyer of fevers, dressing room for death. Flagg visited it often when he felt out of sorts and wanted to cheer himself up. In this devil's marketplace waited all those things that humans, who are made of flesh and are so weak, dread: hammering headaches, screaming stomach cramps, detonations of diarrhea, <strong>vomit</strong>ing, collapsing blood vessels, paralysis of the heart, exploding eyeballs, swelling, blackening tongues, madness.</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 2204 640:Thomas couldn't sleep a wink the night before he was to be crowned in the Plaza of the Needle, and in the early-morning hours of that dread day he was seized by a terrible fit of <strong>vomit</strong>ing and diarrhea brought on by nervousness-it was stage fright. Stage fright sounds both silly and comic, but there was nothing either silly or comic about this. Thomas was still only a little boy, and what he felt in the night, when we are all most alone, was an extremity of fear so great that it would not be wrong to call it mortal terror. He rang for a servant and bade him fetch Flagg. The servant, alarmed by Thomas's pallor and the smell of <strong>vomit</strong> in the room, ran all the way and hardly waited to be given entry before bursting in and telling Flagg that the young prince was very ill indeed, might even be dying.</p>
<p>"Novels\Eyes of the Dragon, The.txt" 2208 265:"I can't go through with it," Thomas moaned. He had <strong>vomit</strong>ed in his bed, and the sheets stank of it. "I can't be King, I can't, please, you have to stop it from happening, how can I go through with it when I may <strong>vomit</strong> in front of Peyna and all of them, <strong>vomit</strong> or . . . or . . .</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 2463 683:Now he's in a world he hardly recognizes, one where movies show on bloated screens called IMAX and everyone on the street is either wearing phones in their ears or staring at tiny screens. There are television cameras watching inside every shop, it seems, and the prices of the most ordinary items-bread, for instance, fifty cents a loaf when he went up-are so high they seem surreal. Everything has changed; he feels glare-blind. He is way behind the curve, and he knows his prison-oriented brain will never catch up. Nor his body. It's stiff when he gets out of bed in the morning, achy when he goes to bed at night; a touch of arthritis, he supposes. After that night of <strong>vomit</strong>ing (and when he wasn't doing that, he was shitting brown water), his appetite just died.</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 4272 135:He stares at it, a small exhumed coffin tilted on the bank in the moonlight. Behind it is the hole, gaping like a mouth that has just <strong>vomit</strong>ed something up. Morris reaches for the trunk again, hesitates, then lunges forward and snaps the latches up, praying to a God he knows cares nothing for the likes of him.</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 4898 36:"I lost track of the time. I was <strong>vomit</strong>ing, and I didn't want to do it inside. It must have been something I ate. Or one of those twenty-four-hour bugs."</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 4900 66:It wasn't anything he ate and he doesn't have a bug, but the <strong>vomit</strong>ing part is true enough. It's nerves. Unadulterated fright, to be more exact. He's terrified about facing Andrew Halliday tomorrow. It could go right, he knows there's a chance for it to go right, but it will be like threading a moving needle. If it goes wrong, he'll be in trouble with his parents and in trouble with the police. College scholarships, need-based or otherwise? Forget them. He might even go to jail. So he has spent the day wandering the paths that crisscross the thirty acres of resort property, going over the coming confrontation again and again. What he will say; what Halliday will say; what he will say in return. And yes, he lost track of time.</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 5328 374:Tina scuttles from the room. Some of the girls are giggling-at thirteen, unscheduled bathroom visits are always amusing-but Tina is too concerned with that rising lump to feel embarrassed. Once in the hall she breaks into a run, heading for the bathroom halfway down the hall as fast as she can, but the lump is faster and she doubles over before she can get there and <strong>vomit</strong>s her breakfast all over her sneakers.</p>
<p>"Novels\Finders Keepers.txt" 5334 121:Tina gropes for the wall with an arm that feels made of plastic. The world is swimming. Part of that is because she has <strong>vomit</strong>ed hard enough to bring tears to her eyes, but not all. She wishes with all her heart that she hadn't let Barbara persuade her into talking to Mr. Hodges, that she had left Pete alone to work out whatever was wrong. What if he never speaks to her again?</p>

<p>Novels\Firestarter.txt 4567 512:Blinding bright sunlight streamed in through the windows on the east side of the cottage. Water dripped and gurgled in the downspouts. The night before, he had got little sleep; the ice had gone out and he had lain awake listening to it-the high, ethereal, and somehow uncanny sound of the old yellow ice splitting and moving slowly down toward the neck of the pond, where the great Hancock River spilled eastward across New Hampshire and all of Maine, growing progressively more smelly and polluted until it <strong>vomit</strong>ed, noisome and dead, into the Atlantic. The sound was like a prolonged crystal note or perhaps that of a bow drawn endlessly across a high violin string-a constant, fluted zzziiiiiinnnggg that settled over the nerve endings and seemed to make them vibrate in sympathy. He had never been here at ice-out before and was not sure he would ever want to be again. There was something terrible and otherworldly about that sound as it vibrated between the silent evergreen walls of this low and eroded bowl of hills.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 1849 132:The sun, going down in a cauldron of blood, glared in his eyes. His stomach had continued to drop, making him feel on the verge of <strong>vomit</strong>ing. The barracks all at once looked two, maybe even three miles away. He set off in that direction, reminding himself to breathe and concentrating on taking big, even steps. Part of him wanted to break into a run, and part of him understood that if he tried doing that, he really might faint.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 2139 163:For Sandy, that was enough. "I have to get out of here, Tony, or I'm gonna be the one who throws up." But what he really felt in danger of was choking, not <strong>vomit</strong>ing. All at once the normally broad avenue of his windpipe was down to a pinhole.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 2189 84:Sandy Dearborn sat at the cluttered worktable in the supply room, listening to him <strong>vomit</strong> and knowing that the <strong>vomit</strong>ing probably meant nothing in the larger scheme of things. Curtis wasn't going to back off. The corpse of the bat-thing had revolted him as much as it had Arky or Huddie or any of them, but he'd come back to examine it more fully, revulsion or no revulsion. The Buick-and the things of the Buick-had become his passion. Even coming out of the storage closet with his throat working and his cheeks pale and his hand pressed to his mouth, Sandy had seen the helpless excitement in his eyes, dimmed only a little by his physical distress. Passion is the hardest taskmaster.</p>

<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 2881 446:Shelves heaped with old files crowded in on three sides. Curt put his microscope on the little desk and plugged its light-source into the closet's one outlet. Sandy, meanwhile, was setting up Huddie Royer's videocam on its sticks. In the video of that peculiar postmortem, one can sometimes see a hand reach into the picture, holding out whatever instrument Curt has called for. It's Sandy Dearborn's hand. And one can hear the sound of <strong>vomit</strong>ing at the end of the tape, loud and clear. That is also Sandy Dearborn.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 3073 828:"Cutting," Curt murmured, and caressed the edge of his scalpel down the sac's lumpy, bulging surface. It split open and black ichor shot out directly into Curt's face, painting his cheeks and splashing his mask. More of it splattered Tony's gloves. Both men recoiled, crying out, while Sandy stood frozen behind the video camera with his jaw hung down. Pouring out of the rapidly deflating sac was a flood of rough black pellets, each of them wrapped in a swaddle of gray membrane. To Sandy they looked like spider-snacks which had been put up in cobweb shrouds. Then he saw that each pellet had an open glazed eye and that each eye seemed to be staring at him, marking him, and that was when his nerve broke. He backed away from the camera, screaming. The screams were replaced by a gagging sound. A moment later he <strong>vomit</strong>ed down the front of his shirt. Sandy himself remembered almost none of that; the five minutes or so following Curt's final incision were pretty much burned out of his memory, and he counted that a mercy.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 3577 106:Sandy turned, the back of his hand pressed hard against his mouth until he was sure he wasn't going to <strong>vomit</strong>, and then he yelled: "Herb! If you still want a look, now's your chance! Quick as you can!"</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 4676 952:Before either of us could take a step toward the barracks, Mister Dillon came out through the hole he'd already put in the screen door. He was staggering from side to side like a drunk, and his head was down. Smoke was rising from his fur. More seemed to be coming out of his head, although at first I couldn't see where it was coming from; everywhere was my first impression. He got his forepaws on the first of the three steps going down from the back stoop to the parking lot, then lost his balance and fell on his side. When he did, he twisted his head in a series of jerks. It was the way people move in those oldtime silent movies. I saw smoke coming out of his nostrils in twin streams. It made me think of the woman sitting there in Lippy's bigfoot truck, the smoke from her cigarette rising in a ribbon that seemed to disappear before it got to the roof. More smoke was coming from his eyes, which had gone a strange, knitted white. He <strong>vomit</strong>ed out a spew of smoky blood, half-dissolved tissue, and triangular white things. After a moment or two I realized they were his teeth.</p>
<p>"Novels\From a Buick 8.txt" 4711 338:He was halfway across the duty room. He turned once to look back at me-toward the sound of my voice-and I saw . . . oh, I saw smoke coming out of his mouth and nose, out of his ears, too. The sides of his mouth drew back and for a second it seemed like he was trying to grin at me, the way dogs will do when they're happy. Then he <strong>vomit</strong>ed. Most of what came out wasn't food but his own insides. And they were smoking.</p>
<p>"Novels\Gerald's Game.txt" 840 86:Jessie heard that thick throat-clearing sound again and suddenly realized she had to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Gerald's Game.txt" 861 13:The urge to <strong>vomit</strong> passed slowly, but it did pass. Jessie lay on her back with her eyes pressed tightly shut, now beginning to really feel the painful throbbing in her shoulders. It came in slow, peristaltic waves, and she had a dismaying idea that this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>"Novels\Gerald's Game.txt" 2214 415:She was almost positive that was a lie, almost positive that strange and forbidden schoolyard word referred to an act that could not be accomplished with just a hand, but doubts remained. With sudden dismay she remembered Karen Aucoin telling her not to ever let a boy put his tongue in her mouth, because it could start a baby in her throat. Karen said it sometimes happened that way, but that a woman who had to <strong>vomit</strong> her baby to get it out almost always died, and usually the baby died, too. I ain't ever going to let a boy French-kiss me, Karen said. I might let one feel me on top, if I really loved him, but I don't ever want a baby in my throat. How would you EAT?</p>
<p>"Novels\Gerald's Game.txt" 2304 329:Her revulsion turned to guilty horror, and Jessie quickly fished the underpants back out. All at once the flat odor seemed to fill her nose, thick and bland and sickening. Oysters and copper, she thought, and that was all it took. She fell on her knees in front of the toilet, the underpants wadded up in one clenched hand, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. She flushed quickly, before the smell of partly digested hamburger could get into the air, then turned on the cold sink-tap and rinsed her mouth out. Her fear that she was going to spend the next hour or so in here, kneeling in front of the toilet and puking, began to subside. Her stomach seemed to be settling. If she could just keep from getting another whiff of that bland copper-creamy smell . . .</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 324 454:She reshouldered her pack (this time putting it on over the poncho) and walked carefully toward the bluff and the fallen ash tree. She now looked back on her panicky plunge through the woods with the mixture of indulgence and embarrassment adults feel when looking back upon the worst of their childhood behavior, but she found she could still not go very close to the edge. It would make her feel sick if she did. She might faint again . . . or <strong>vomit</strong>. <strong>vomit</strong>ing up any of her food when she had so little would be a very bad idea.</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1076 42:"Oh sugartit," Trisha said, and then <strong>vomit</strong>ed again. She couldn't see what was coming out, it was too dark for that and she was glad, but it felt thin, more like soup than puke. Something about the almost-rhyme of those two words, soup and puke, made her stomach immediately knot up again. She backed away from the trees between which she had thrown up, still on her knees, and then her bowels cramped again, this time more fiercely.</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1084 328:Her feet were completely numb by the time she stepped out of the stream; her backside was also pretty numb, but at least she was clean again. She put on her underwear and her pants and was just doing the snap on the jeans when her stomach clenched again. Trisha took two big steps back to the trees, clutched the same one, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed again. This time there seemed to be nothing solid in it at all; it was like ejecting two cups of hot water. She leaned forward and put her forehead against the pine tree's sticky bark. For just a moment she could imagine a sign on it, like the kind people hung over the doors of their lakeside and seaside camps: TRISHA'S PUKIN' PLACE. That made her laugh again, but it was bad laughter. And through all the air between these woods and the world she had so foolishly believed was hers, that jingle was playing again, the one that went "Dial 1-800-54-GIANT."</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1092 121:The cramp loosened. Trisha walked slowly back to her shelter on legs that felt rubbery and unstable. Her back hurt from <strong>vomit</strong>ing; her stomach muscles felt oddly sprung. And her skin was hot. She thought maybe she had a fever.</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1104 108:But she knew better, and didn't need the cold voice to tell her anything. She was already thirsty again, <strong>vomit</strong>ing and the aftertaste of fiddleheads had made the thirst even stronger, and she would be revisiting the stream soon enough.</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1136 92:I can't <strong>vomit</strong> any more. Please God, I can't <strong>vomit</strong> any more. It'll kill me if I go on <strong>vomit</strong>ing.</p>
<p>"Novels\Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The.txt" 1173 697:Around noon, Trisha stumbled over a rock and sprawled full-length in a brambly snarl of bushes. She lay there with the breath knocked out of her and her heart hammering so hard it made white lights in front of her eyes. The first time she attempted to drag herself back to open ground she couldn't do it. She waited, rested, tried for stillness with her eyes half-closed, and then went for it again. This time she pulled herself free, but when she tried to get up, her legs wouldn't support her. No wonder, either, not really. Over the last forty-eight hours she'd had nothing to eat but a hardboiled egg, a tuna sandwich, two Twinkies, and a few fiddleheads. She'd also had diarrhea and <strong>vomit</strong>ing.</p>
<p>"Novels\Green Mile, The.txt" 352 1132:I did, but before I did, I stepped out onto the back porch to empty out (and checked the wind direction with a wet thumb before I did-what our parents tell us when we are small seldom goes ignored, no matter how foolish it may be). Peeing outdoors is one joy of country living the poets never quite got around to, but it was no joy that night; the water coming out of me burned like a line of lit coal-oil. Yet I thought it had been a little worse that afternoon, and knew it had been worse the two or three days before. I had hopes that maybe I had started to mend. Never was a hope more ill-founded. No one had told me that sometimes a bug that gets up inside there, where it's warm and wet, can take a day or two off to rest before coming on strong again. I would have been surprised to know it. I would have been even more surprised to know that, in another fifteen or twenty years, there would be pills you could take that would smack that sort of infection out of your system in record time . . . and while those pills might make you feel a little sick at your stomach or loose in your bowels, they almost never made you <strong>vomit</strong> the way Dr. Sadler's sulfa pills did. Back in '32, there wasn't much you could do but wait, and try to ignore that feeling that someone had spilled coal-oil inside your works and then touched a match to it.</p>
<p>"Novels\Green Mile, The.txt" 2894 66:I wiped at the foam on Delacroix's chest, then had to gag back <strong>vomit</strong> as a large, hot section of his skin simply slid away from the flesh beneath, the way the skin will slide off a . . . well, you know. A done tom turkey.</p>
<p>"Novels\Green Mile, The.txt" 4291 314:I started forward. Before I got two steps, John knee-walked away from me and into the corner of the room, still coughing harshly and dragging for each breath. He laid his forehead against the wallpaper-wild red roses overspreading a garden wall-and made a gruesome deep hacking sound, as if he were trying to <strong>vomit</strong> up the lining of his own throat. That'll bring the bugs if anything can, I remember thinking, but there was no sign of them. All the same, his coughing fit seemed to ease a little.</p>
<p>"Novels\Gwendy's Button Box.txt" 959 311:Gwendy is sick for days afterward. Mr. and Mrs. Peterson believe grief is causing their daughter's fever and upset stomach, but Gwendy knows better. It's the box. It's the price she has to pay for pushing the red button. She heard the rumble of the collapsing rocks, and had to run into the bathroom and <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 1533 297:Ralph went home and sat staring not at the TV but through it for an hour or so. He got up during a commercial to see if there was a cold Coke in the refrigerator, staggered on his feet, and had to put a hand on the wall to steady himself. He was trembling all over and felt unpleasantly close to <strong>vomit</strong>ing. He understood that this was nothing but delayed reaction, but the weakness and nausea still frightened him.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 2897 148:He closed his eyes tightly for a moment. His stomach was fluttering lightly just below his Adam's apple and he was suddenly sure he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 3731 95:It turned out to be the room he needed. Ralph dropped to his knees in front of the toilet and <strong>vomit</strong>ed with his eyes closed and his left arm clamped tightly against the hole Pickering had made in his side. The pain as his muscles first locked and then pushed was still enormous.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 4006 97:One of Carolyn's eyes popped out and lay on the wet sand like a blob of blueberry jelly. Bugs <strong>vomit</strong>ed from the now-empty socket.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 10520 575:He had expected something which would look and smell like the rotting guts in the bins behind Mr. Huston's knacker's shop, but the reality was even worse, possibly because it was so unexpected. There were fans of a bloody, mucusy substance on the doors themselves-marks made by Atropos's restless fingers, perhaps-and a revolting large puddle of the same stuff sinking into the hardened residue in front of the doors. There was something so terrible about this stuff-so alien-that it made the color-bugs look almost normal by comparison. It was like a pool of <strong>vomit</strong> left by a dog suffering from some new and dangerous strain of rabies. A trail of this stuff led away from the puddle, first in drying clots and splashes, then in smaller drips like spilled paint.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 11760 110:Good riddance, Ralph thought. At least I didn't get much on myself. There's that. He no longer felt like <strong>vomit</strong>ing. Now he felt like crying.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 12462 105:There was a scary sensation of weightlessness and vertigo, and for a moment he was sure he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. This was accompanied by a feeling of drain, as if much of the power he had taken in from Lois was now being siphoned off. He supposed it was. This was a form of teleportation, after all, fabulous science-fiction stuff, and something like that had to use up a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Novels\Insomnia.txt 12682 199:At last he'd struck it against a nearby tree, breaking its back. It had dropped to the grass, still flopping, and Ralph had stamped on it with one foot, provoking the final horror. A spew of guts <strong>vomit</strong>ed from its mouth, and from the place where Ralph's heel had smashed it open had come a gluey torrent of bloody eggs. That was when he had realized that the Kingfish had really been the Queenfish, and only a day or two from roeing.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 1169 51:Rich felt like he was doing pretty good until the <strong>vomit</strong>ing started.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 1401 251:But that was too much and he ran for the bathroom, blundering into his Eames chair on his way and almost falling. He made it . . . barely. He slid across the slick tiles to the toilet on his knees like some weird break-dancer, gripped the edges, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed everything in his guts. Even then it wouldn't stop; suddenly he could see Georgie Denbrough as if he had last seen him yesterday, Georgie who had been the start of it all, Georgie who had been murdered in the fall of 1957. Georgie had died right after the flood, one of his arms had been ripped from its socket, and Rich had blocked all of that out of his memory. But sometimes those things come back, oh yes indeedy, they come back, sometimes they come back.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 7925 115:Beverly felt as if her throat had been lined with slate. Her heart raced in her chest. She thought that she might <strong>vomit</strong> soon. There was blood on the mirror, running in long drips. There were spots of blood on the light over the sink; she could smell it cooking onto the 40-watt bulb. Blood ran down the porcelain sides of the sink and plopped in fat drops on the linoleum floor.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 10816 55:"Excuse me," Beverly said distantly. "I have to <strong>vomit</strong>, I think."</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 11098 115:Trembling, white-faced, Ben walked across the echoing center of the adults' library. He felt that soon he would <strong>vomit</strong>. He stood in front of a shelf of books and took one down at random with a hand that trembled badly. His cold fingers flittered the pages.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 15759 329:His eyes fluttered open and he saw Beverly kneeling beside him, wiping his mouth with a handkerchief. The others-Bill, Eddie, Stan, and Ben-stood behind her, their faces solemn and scared. The side of Richie's face hurt like hell. He tried to speak to Beverly and could only croak. He tried to clear his throat and almost <strong>vomit</strong>ed. His throat and lungs felt as if they had somehow been lined with smoke.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 15855 100:Richie felt the words in his throat, but he had to struggle to bring them out. It felt almost like <strong>vomit</strong>ing again. "We saw It come," he said at last. "I think that was it."</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 17085 117:She didn't know, not for sure, but it scared her. She didn't think she had been this scared since the blood had <strong>vomit</strong>ed out of the bathroom drain and splattered all over everything. Some deep part of her cried out that if they discovered she had seen this, whatever it was, they might do more than hurt her; they might actually kill her.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 17256 75:But it did. Patrick ejected a huge spray of blood and parasite-flesh like <strong>vomit</strong>. He fell down in the gravelly dirt and began to roll over and over, still screaming. Little by little the sound of his own screams began to seem faint, faraway.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 19678 40:not to <strong>vomit</strong>. He was afraid that if he <strong>vomit</strong>ed, all of his guts would come up . . . and there were five of them still to get.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 20355 240:Each had his or her own different vision of the same end. Ben saw bushes which suddenly became man-eating plants. Beverly saw flying leeches like the ones that had come out of that old refrigerator. Stan saw the mucky ground in the bamboo <strong>vomit</strong>ing up the living corpses of children caught in there by the fabled quickmud. Mike Hanlon imagined small Jurassic reptiles with horrid sawteeth suddenly boiling out of the cleft of a rotten tree, attacking them, biting them to pieces. Richie saw the Crawling Eye oozing down on top of them as they ran under the railroad trestle. And Eddie saw them climbing the Old Cape embankment only to look up and see the leper standing at the top, his sagging flesh acrawl with beetles and maggots, waiting for them.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 21208 338:Before the universe there had been only two things. One was Itself and the other was the Turtle. The Turtle was a stupid old thing that never came out of its shell. It thought that maybe the Turtle was dead, had been dead for the last billion years or so. Even if it wasn't, it was still a stupid old thing, and even if the Turtle had <strong>vomit</strong>ed the universe out whole, that didn't change the fact of its stupidity.</p>
<p>Novels\IT.txt 22845 234:Ben lurched after it on legs that felt like stilts and brought his foot down again. He felt the spider's body crunch and splatter under the heel of his boot. His gorge clenched and this time there was no way he could hold back. He <strong>vomit</strong>ed, then twisted his heel, grinding the thing into the stones, listening to the cries in his head fade to nothing.</p>
<p>Novels\Joyland.txt 650 79:"I'll pitch in where I have to," she said. "If it includes mopping up <strong>vomit</strong> as well as snapping pictures, so be it. I need this job. I've got grad school staring me in the face next year, and I'm exactly two steps from broke."</p>
<p>Novels\Joyland.txt 1960 610:"I like it," I said, and I did. That was my year to embrace loneliness. I sometimes went to the movies in Lumberton or Myrtle Beach with Mrs. Shoplaw and Tina Ackerley, the librarian with the goo-goo-googly eyes, but I spent most evenings in my room, re-reading The Lord of the Rings and writing letters to Erin, Tom, and my dad. I also wrote a fair amount of poetry, which I am now embarrassed even to think about. Thank God I burned it. I added a new and satisfyingly grim record to my small collection-The Dark Side of the Moon. In the Book of Proverbs we are advised that "as a dog returns to its <strong>vomit</strong>, so a fool repeats his folly." That autumn I returned to Dark Side again and again, only giving Floyd the occasional rest so I could listen to Jim Morrison once more intone, "This is the end, beautiful friend." Such a really bad case of the twenty-ones-I know, I know.</p>
<p>Novels\Joyland.txt 2640 248:I did that five or six times before he started breathing on his own again. I stopped the compressions to see what would happen, and he kept going. Hell must have been full that day, that's all I can figure. I rolled him onto his side in case he <strong>vomit</strong>ed. Lane stood beside me with a hand on my shoulder. Shortly after that, we heard the wail of an approaching siren.</p>
<p>Novels\Joyland.txt 3578 214:He wheeled ahead to the Pup-A-Licious shy, his own pup trotting beside him. She turned to me. "It's not about nutrition, if that's what you're thinking. If he gets sick to his stomach, he might <strong>vomit</strong>. And <strong>vomit</strong>ing is dangerous for kids in Mike's condition. They-"</p>
<p>"Novels\Lisey's Story.txt" 2975 95:She was up and rushing for the sink so fast she knocked her chair over, sure she was going to <strong>vomit</strong> everything she'd just eaten, she was going to blow her groceries, toss her cookies, throw her heels, donate her lunch. She hung over the sink, eyes closed, mouth open, midsection locked and straining. After a pregnant five-second pause, she produced one monstrous cola-burp that buzzed like a cicada. She leaned there a moment longer, wanting to make absolutely sure that was all. When she was, she rinsed her mouth, spat, and pulled "Zack McCool"'s letter from her jeans pocket. It was time to call Joseph Woodbody.</p>
<p>"Novels\Lisey's Story.txt" 3507 235:She approached it, dropped onto her knees, swept back the hem of the dropcloth that covered it, and peered beneath. And there, in that musty, enclosed space where the smell of old chickenshit had come creeping back (like a dog to its <strong>vomit</strong>, she thought), was what she had been looking for.</p>
<p>"Novels\Lisey's Story.txt" 4389 223:"Those are-" What was she going to tell him? Those are bools, not books? She guessed that most of them were, but Dooley wouldn't understand. They're practical jokes, Scott's version of itchy-powder and plastic <strong>vomit</strong>? That he'd understand but likely not believe.</p>
<p>"Novels\Lisey's Story.txt" 4544 1575:And how is she supposed to respond to that? What, exactly, are the symptoms he's displaying? Would any doctor-even a sympathetic one like Rick Bjorn-take them seriously? He's stopped listening to music when he writes, that's one thing. And he's not writing much, that's another, much bigger, thing. Forward progress on his new novel-which Lisey Landon, admittedly no great book critic, happens to love-has slowed from his usual all-out sprint to a labored crawl. Bigger still . . . dear Christ, where's his sense of humor? That boisterous sense of good humor can be wearing, but its sudden absence as fall gives way to cold weather is downright spooky; it's like the moment in one of those old jungle movies where the native drums suddenly fall silent. He's drinking more, too, and later into the night. She has always gone to bed earlier than he does-usually much earlier-but she almost always knows when he turns in and what she smells on his breath when he does. She also knows what she sees in his trashcans up in his study, and as her worries grow, she makes a special point to look every two or three days. She's used to seeing beer cans, sometimes a great lot of them, Scott has always liked his beer, but in December of 1995 and early January of 1996 she also begins to see Jim Beam bottles. And Scott is suffering hangovers. For some reason this bothers her more than all the rest. Sometimes he wanders the house-pale, silent, ill-until the middle of the afternoon before finally perking up. On several occasions she has heard him <strong>vomit</strong>ing behind the closed bathroom door, and she knows by the speed with which the aspirin is disappearing that he's suffering bad headaches. Nothing unusual in that, you might say; drink a case of beer or a bottle of Beam between nine and midnight, you're gonna pay the price, Patrick. And maybe that's all it is, but Scott has been a heavy drinker since the night she met him in that University lounge, when he had a bottle squirreled away in his jacket pocket (he shared it with her), and he's never suffered more than the mildest of hangovers. Now when she sees the empties in his wastebasket and that only a page or two has been added to the Outlaw's Honeymoon manuscript on his big desk (some days there are no new pages at all), she wonders just how much more he's drinking than what she knows about.</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 800 66:"No," she said. "No, Paul. A little at a time, or you'll <strong>vomit</strong>."</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 976 369:She removed the grill and set the rest of the manuscript into the pot, crunching down the crispy black curls of the pages he had already burned. The room stank of matches and burned paper. Smells like the devil's cloakroom, he thought deliriously, and if there had been anything in the wrinkled walnut-shell that had once been his stomach, he supposed he would have <strong>vomit</strong>ed it up.</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 2319 133:"Can I go on now, Paul, or were you planning to have a sneezing fit? Should I get the bucket? Do you feel as if you might have to <strong>vomit</strong> a few times?"</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 2970 254:But the dustcloth in his mouth was the worst. The stink of the furniture polish was making his head ache, and he was growing steadily more nauseated. He concentrated grimly on controlling it; he had no interest in choking to death, his windpipe full of <strong>vomit</strong>, while Annie argued with an elderly town official who got his hair trimmed once a week at the local tonsorial emporium and probably wore rubbers over his black oxfords all winter long.</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 3011 11:"If you <strong>vomit</strong> I guess you'll just have to lie in it. Looks like I've got other fish to fry. He said something about a lien on my house. What's that?"</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 3399 315:"Yes . . ." She sighed. "I do want to know how it comes out. That's the only thing left in the world that I still want, I suppose." Slowly, apparently unaware of what she was doing, she began to suck the rat's blood from her fingers. Paul jammed his teeth together and grimly told himself he would not <strong>vomit</strong>, would not, would not. "It's like waiting for the end of one of those chapter-plays."</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 4836 1143:Paul had been convinced Gary's reaction had been more than false; he thought it had been pretentiously arty. In short, a pose. He continued to feel this way until 1983, when he read The World According to Garp. He made the mistake of reading the scene where Garp's younger son dies, impaled on a gearshift lever, shortly before bed. It was hours before he slept. The scene would not leave his mind. The thought that grieving for a fictional character was absurd did more than cross his mind during his tossings and turnings. For grieving was exactly what he was doing, of course. The realization had not helped, however, and this had caused him to wonder if perhaps Gary Ruddman hadn't been a lot more serious about Van der Valk than Paul had given him credit for at the time. And this had caused another memory to resurface: finishing William Golding's Lord of the Flies at the age of twelve on a hot summer day, going to the refrigerator for a cold glass of lemonade . . . and then suddenly changing direction and speeding up from an amble to an all-out bolt which had ended in the bathroom. There he had leaned over the toilet and <strong>vomit</strong>ed.</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 5053 6:Paul <strong>vomit</strong>ed beside the chair with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Novels\Misery.txt 5253 339:"I have a driveway chain. I'm going to use it. If the police come, it may raise suspicion, but I'd rather have them suspicious than have them drive up to the house and hear you making a big cockadoodie fuss. I thought of gagging you, but gags are dangerous, especially if you're taking drugs that affect respiration. Or you might <strong>vomit</strong>. Or your sinuses might close up because it's so damp down here. If your sinuses closed up tight and you couldn't breathe through your mouth . . ."</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 2248 148:"One time she agreed to take me to a concert. It was U2, and I was mad to see them. Ollie liked them, too, but the night of the show she started <strong>vomit</strong>ing. It was so bad that my parents ended up taking her to the ER and I had to stay home watching TV instead of pogoing and screaming for Bono. Ollie swore it was food poisoning, but we all ate the same meal, and no one else got sick. Stress is what it was. Pure stress. And you talk about hypochondria? With my sister, every headache was a brain tumor and every pimple was skin cancer. Once she got pinkeye and spent a week convinced she was going blind. Her periods were horroramas. She took to her bed until they were over."</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 2284 260:"My mother and father tried for years to get her to see a shrink. Where they failed, Kent succeeded. The shrink put her on pills, and she got better. She had one of her patented anxiety attacks on her wedding day-I was the one who held her veil while she <strong>vomit</strong>ed in the church bathroom-but she got through it." Janey smiles wistfully and adds, "She was a beautiful bride."</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 3024 403:The active ingredient in Gopher-Go is strychnine. Brady looks up the symptoms of strychnine poisoning on the Net and is delighted to find that Odell will have a tough time of it. Twenty minutes or so after ingestion, muscle spasms start in the neck and head. They quickly spread to the rest of the body. The mouth stretches in a grin (at least in humans; Brady doesn't know about dogs). There may be <strong>vomit</strong>ing, but by then too much of the poison has been absorbed and it's too late. Convulsions set in and get worse until the backbone turns into a hard and constant arch. Sometimes the spine actually snaps. When death comes-as a relief, Brady is sure-it's as a result of asphyxiation. The neural pathways tasked with running air to the lungs from the outside world just give up.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 4486 280:Brady uses the opportunity to go online and learn all about the upcoming 'Round Here concert. He watches a YouTube video where a giggle of girls discusses which of the five boys is the hottest. The consensus is Cam, who sings lead on "Look Me in My Eyes," a piece of audio <strong>vomit</strong> Brady vaguely recalls hearing on the radio last year. He imagines those laughing faces torn apart by ball bearings, those identical Guess jeans in burning tatters.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 4670 315:That gurgling cry comes again. Brady runs for the living room, kicking one of the Long John Silver's bags under the kitchen table and leaving the refrigerator door open. His mother is sitting bolt upright on the couch. She's in her blue silk lounging pajamas. The shirt is covered with a bib of blood-streaked <strong>vomit</strong>. Her belly protrudes, straining the buttons; it's the belly of a woman who is seven months pregnant. Her hair stands out from her parchment-pale face in a mad spray. Her nostrils are clotted with blood. Her eyes bulge. She's not seeing him, or so he thinks at first, but then she holds out her hands.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 4700 368:Instead of answering, she begins to march again. Her head snaps up and her bulging eyes regard the ceiling for a second or two before her head snaps forward again. Her back doesn't move at all; it's as if her head is mounted on bearings. The gurgling sounds return-the sound of water trying to go down a partially clogged drain. Her mouth yawns and she belches <strong>vomit</strong>. It lands in her lap with a wet splat, and oh God, it's half blood.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 4766 75:He yanks up her pants, making her decent again-as decent as a corpse in <strong>vomit</strong>-soaked pj's can be-and lifts her onto her bed, groaning as fresh pain settles into his back. When he straightens up this time, he can feel his spine crackling. He thinks about taking off her nightclothes and replacing them with something clean-one of the XL tee-shirts she sometimes wears to bed, maybe-but that would mean more lifting and manipulation of what is now just pounds of silent flesh hanging from bone coathangers. What if he threw his back out?</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 5001 778:His old Boy Scout sleeping bag is spread out on the basement floor, on top of an air mattress he scrounged from the garage. The air mattress has a slow leak. Brady supposes he ought to replace it if he means to continue sleeping down here for whatever short stretch of life remains to him. And where else can he sleep? He can't bring himself to use his bed on the second floor, not with his mother lying dead in her own bed just down the hall, maybe already rotting her way into the sheets. He's turned on her air conditioner and cranked it up to HI COOL, but he's under no illusions about how well that will work. Or for how long. Nor is sleeping on the living room couch an option. He cleaned it as well as he could, and turned the cushions, but it still smells of her <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 5684 641:Holly Gibney is in the bathroom of the house in Sugar Heights, wishing she could skip the memorial service, knowing her mother will never let her. If she protests that she doesn't feel well, her mother's return serve will be one that goes all the way back to Holly's childhood: What will people think. And if Holly should protest that it doesn't matter what people think, they are never going to see any of these people (with the exception of Janey) again in their lives? Her mother would look at her as if Holly were speaking a foreign language. She takes her Lexapro, but her insides knot while she's brushing her teeth and she <strong>vomit</strong>s it back up. Charlotte calls to ask if she's almost ready. Holly calls back that she almost is. She flushes the toilet and thinks, At least Janey's boyfriend will be there. Bill. He's nice.</p>
<p>"Novels\Mr. Mercedes.txt" 7409 179:Hodges puts his phone on the night table and draws the coverlet down to Mrs. Hartsfield's feet. She's wearing blue silk pajamas. The shirt is stained with what appears to be <strong>vomit</strong> and some blood, but there's no visible bullet hole or stab wound. Her face is swollen, yet there are no ligature marks or bruises on her neck. The swelling is just the slow death-march of decomposition. He pulls up her pajama top enough so he can see her belly. Like her face, it's slightly swollen, but he's betting that's gas. He leans close to her mouth, looks inside, and sees what he expected: clotted goop on her tongue and in the gutters between her gums and her cheeks. He's guessing she got drunk, sicked up her last meal, and went out like a rock star. The blood could be from her throat. Or an aggravated stomach ulcer.</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 8114 281:Around and around these thoughts went, a jumble of terror, guilt, and misery set to the beat of Elvis Presley's golden hits. By noon, Brian's stomach had begun to roil and knot. He hurried down to the bathroom at the end of the hall in his stocking feet, closed the door, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed into the toilet bowl as quietly as he could. His mother didn't hear. She was still in her room, where Elvis was now telling her he wanted to be her teddy bear.</p>

His arms were still raised, but as Don Hemphill neared the pulpit, Rose lowered them and involuntarily clapped one hand over his nose and mouth. He thought he might <strong>vomit</strong>. It was the most incredible nose-buster of a stink he had ever encountered. "What . . . what has happened?"</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 14249 99:Screams, roars of outrage, and furious curses blued the air. And as the rain started outside, the <strong>vomit</strong>ing began inside.</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 14327 375:When Father Brigham was halfway down the short flight of steps, a flash of lightning showed him the crowbar propped against the door of the Daughters of Isabella Hall. A moment later one of the windows on the right side of the building shattered outward and women began to hurl themselves through the hole, tumbling on the lawn like large rag dolls which had learned how to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 14346 308:"Come on, Rev'rund!" she shouted. Her face, glimpsed in a blue-white flash of lightning, was the twisted face of a harpy. She was still wearing her white rayon uniform-she had always made it a habit to dress just as she had her waitresses dress-but the swell of her bosom was now wearing a bib of <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 14352 322:The moment the crowbars were gone, the doors flew open-one was torn entirely off its hinges and tumbled into the flowerbed on the left side of the steps. A flood of wild-eyed Baptists poured out, stumbling and falling all over one another as they pelted down the church steps. They stank. They wept. They coughed. They <strong>vomit</strong>ed.</p>
<p>"Novels\Needful Things.txt" 14388 313:The Baptist Anti-Gambling Christian Soldiers strode up Harrington Street from the Baptist Church in the pouring rain with Don Hemphill, Nan Roberts, Norman Harper, and William Rose in the forefront. Their eyes were reddened, furious orbs peering from puffy, irritated sockets. Most of the Christian Soldiers had <strong>vomit</strong> on their pants, their shirts, their shoes, or all three. The rotten-egg smell of the stink-bomb clung to them in spite of the sheeting rain, refusing to be washed away.</p>
<p>"Novels\Outsider, The.txt" 10225 39:She abruptly leaned over the rail and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. He held her while she did it.</p>
<p>"Novels\Pet Sematary.txt" 768 891:"Well, cats live as long as dogs," he said, "mostly, anyway." This was a lie, and he knew it. Cats lived violent lives and often died bloody deaths, always just below the usual range of human sight. Here was Church, dozing in the sun (or appearing to), Church who slept peacefully on his daughter's bed every night, Church who had been so cute as a kitten, all tangled up in a ball of string. And yet Louis had seen him stalk a bird with a broken wing, his green eyes sparkling with curiosity and-yes, Louis would have sworn it-cold delight. He rarely killed what he stalked, but there had been one notable exception-a large rat, probably caught in the alley between their apartment house and the next. Church had really put the blocks to that baby. It had been so bloody and gore-flecked that Rachel, then in her sixth month with Gage, had had to run into the bathroom and <strong>vomit</strong>. Violent lives, violent deaths. A dog got them and ripped them open instead of just chasing them like the bumbling, easily fooled dogs in the TV cartoons, or another tom got them, or a poisoned bait, or a passing car. Cats were the gangsters of the animal world, living outside the law and often dying there. There were a great many of them who never grew old by the fire.</p>
<p>"Novels\Pet Sematary.txt" 1304 125:Louis opened his mouth to answer, and one of the candy-stripers abruptly dropped her end of the hard stretcher and ran out, <strong>vomit</strong>ing down the front of her pinafore. A phone began to ring. The girl who had been sobbing now began to scream the dead man's name-"Vic! Vic! Vic!"-over and over. Bedlam. Confusion. One of the cops was asking Charlton if they could have a blanket to cover him up, and Charlton was saying she didn't know if she had the authority to requisition one, and Louis found himself thinking of a line from Maurice Sendak: "Let the wild rumpus start!"</p>

<p>"Novels\Pet Sematary.txt" 3591 348:Louis grabbed the boy under the arms, aware in a distant way of how hot his son's armpits were under the Dr. Denton suit, and put him up on his shoulder as if to burp him. Then Louis snapped himself backward, jerking Gage with him. Gage's neck whiplashed. He uttered a loud bark that was not quite a belch, and an amazing flag of almost solid <strong>vomit</strong> flew from his mouth and spattered on the floor and the dresser. Gage began to cry again, a solid, bawling sound that was music to Louis's ears. To cry like that you had to be getting an unlimited supply of oxygen.</p>
<p>"Novels\Pet Sematary.txt" 3607 62:It was milk that had almost surely caused the fresh round of <strong>vomit</strong>ing. Gage had awakened around midnight, she said, an hour or so after Louis had gone to sleep, with his "hungry cry," and Rachel had gotten him a bottle. She had drowsed off again herself while he was still taking it. About an hour later, the choking spell began.</p>
<p>"Novels\Pet Sematary.txt" 5000 88:Louis dumped the rest of the beer down the sink, feeling suddenly that he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. The room was moving around in great swinging motions.</p>

<p>Novels\Revival.txt 1792 645:Paul rolled a short riff on his drums to get the crowd's attention, finishing with a cymbal-clang. There was a brief spatter of anticipatory applause. There were all those eyes (millions, it seemed to me) looking up at the little stage where we were crowded together under the lights. I remember feeling incredibly stupid in my rhinestone-­studded vest (the vests were holdovers from the brief period when Chrome Roses had been the Gunslingers), and wondering if I was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. It hardly seemed possible, since I'd only picked at lunch and hadn't been able to eat any supper at all, but it sure felt that way. Then I thought, Not <strong>vomit</strong>. Faint. That's what I'm going to do, faint.</p>
<p>Novels\Revival.txt 3601 590:Hugh sat in the office, the cloth (still damp but now warm) clutched in one hand, seriously considering Jacobs's proposal, and a large part of his mind found serious consideration, even on such short acquaintance, perfectly normal. He was a musician who had gone deaf and been cast aside by a band he'd helped to found, one now on the verge of national success. Other players and at least one great composer-Beethoven-had lived with deafness, but hearing loss wasn't where Hugh's woes ended. There was the vertigo, the trembling, the periodic loss of vision. There was nausea, <strong>vomit</strong>ing, diarrhea, galloping pulse. Worst of all was the almost constant tinnitus. He had always thought deafness meant silence. This was not true, at least not in his case. Hugh Yates had a constantly braying burglar alarm in the middle of his head.</p>
<p>Novels\Revival.txt 4000 324:I found him standing beneath a pole light fifteen feet away, bent double and grasping his knees. The night had cooled considerably, and the puddle between his feet was steaming lightly. As I approached, his body heaved and the puddle grew larger. When I touched his arm, he jerked and stumbled, almost falling into his own <strong>vomit</strong>, which would have made for a fragrant ride home.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 26 233:Except it isn't sweat and it isn't pee. It's blood. She's sitting here in the corner of the living room, looking at a dismembered paperback lying half on the sofa and under the coffee-table, and her womb is getting ready to <strong>vomit</strong> up the baby it has so far carried with no complaint or problem whatsoever.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 187 857:None of that took his temper into account, however. He had a bad one, very bad, and sometimes he slipped. That was what had happened last night, when she brought him a second glass of iced tea and spilled some on his hand. Pow, and her nose was gushing like a broken water-main before he even knew what he was doing. She saw the look of disgust on his face as the blood poured down over her mouth and chin, then the look of worried calculation-what if her nose was actually broken? That would mean another trip to the hospital. For a moment she'd thought one of the real beatings was coming, one of the ones that left her huddled in the corner, gasping and crying and trying to get back enough breath so she could <strong>vomit</strong>. In her apron. Always in her apron. You did not cry out in this house, or argue with the management, and you most certainly did not <strong>vomit</strong> on the floor-not if you wanted to keep your head screwed on tight, that was.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 1112 216:Daniels made an inarticulate growling sound, the sort of sound that a person should only have to hear while visiting the zoo, and gave Ramon's balls another squeeze. The pain was unbearable. He leaned forward and <strong>vomit</strong>ed between his knees-white chunks of curd laced with brown streaks that was probably the remains of the quesadilla he'd eaten for lunch. Daniels did not seem to notice. He was gazing into the sky above the jungle gym, lost in his own world.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 2275 806:Sure, that was probably a better idea. Men-especially those past forty-for some reason felt more comfortable with that word than they did with women. It was silly (and the way some women fussed and clucked over the semantics was even sillier, in Rose's opinion), but thinking about it called up a sudden memory: how Norman talked about the prostitutes he sometimes busted. He never called them ladies (that was the word he used when talking about the wives of his colleagues, as in "Bill Jessup's wife's a real nice lady"); he never called them women, either. He called them the gals. The gals this and the gals that. She had never realized until this moment how much she had hated that hard little back-of-the-throat word. Gals. Like a sound you might make when you were trying hard not to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 2281 638:Rosie closed the refrigerator door, turned around, and looked across her room. The furnishings were minimal and the decorations-except for her picture-were nonexistent, but she still saw nothing which did not make her want to crow with delight. There were pretty cream-colored walls that Norman Daniels had never seen, there was a chair from which Norman Daniels had never pushed her for "being smart," there was a TV Norman Daniels had never watched, sneering at the news or laughing along with reruns of All in the Family and Cheers. Best of all, there was not a single corner where she'd sat crying and reminding herself to <strong>vomit</strong> into her apron if she got sick to her stomach. Because he wasn't here. He wasn't going to be here.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 2510 309:Maybe, but they don't look like you, her mind whispered, and don't you go thinking that they do, Rosie. They look confident, they look happy, and most of all they look like they belong here. You don't and you never will. There were too many years with Norman, too many times when you sat in the corner <strong>vomit</strong>ing into your apron. You've forgotten how people are, and what they talk about . . . if you ever knew to begin with. If you try to be like these people, if you even dream you can be like these people, you are going to earn yourself a broken heart.</p>
<p>"Novels\Rose Madder.txt" 6803 20:Bill made a choked <strong>vomit</strong>ing sound and staggered against her, sending her into the wall of the staircase. As she struggled to keep from going to her knees, she heard a rush of footsteps in the dark as Norman came for them.</p>
<p>"Novels\Shining, The.txt" 770 227:A week passed. He and Wendy didn't speak much. But he knew she was watching, not believing. He drank coffee black and endless cans of Coca-Cola. One night he drank a whole six-pack of Coke and then ran into the bathroom and <strong>vomit</strong>ed it up. The level of the bottles in the liquor cabinet did not go down. After his classes he went over to Al Shockley's-she hated Al Shockley worse than she had ever hated anyone-and when he came home she would swear she smelled scotch or gin on his breath, but he would talk lucidly to her before supper, drink coffee, play with Danny after supper, sharing a Coke with him, read him a bedtime story, then sit and correct themes with cup after cup of black coffee by his hand, and she would have to admit to herself that she had been wrong.</p>
<p>"Novels\Shining, The.txt" 1145 621:For Wendy, it was discovering truth in a cliché: her breath was taken away. For a moment she was unable to breathe at all; the view had knocked the wind from her. They were standing near the top of one peak. Across from them-who knew how far?-an even taller mountain reared into the sky, its jagged tip only a silhouette that was now nimbused by the sun, which was beginning its decline. The whole valley floor was spread out below them, the slopes that they had climbed in the laboring bug falling away with such dizzying suddenness that she knew to look down there for too long would bring on nausea and eventual <strong>vomit</strong>ing. The imagination seemed to spring to full life in the clear air, beyond the rein of reason, and to look was to helplessly see one's self plunging down and down and down, sky and slopes changing places in slow cartwheels, the scream drifting from your mouth like a lazy balloon as your hair and your dress billowed out …</p>

<p>"Novels\Shining, The.txt" 9394 605:He picked up the gascan and struggled over to the snowmobile. His consciousness seemed to be flickering in and out, offering him cuttings and snippets of home movies but never the whole picture. In one of these he was aware of yanking the snowmobile back onto its tread and then sitting on it, out of breath and incapable of moving for a few moments. In another, he was reattaching the gascan, which was still half-full. His head was thumping horribly from the gas fumes (and in reaction to his battle with the hedge lion, he supposed), and he saw by the steaming hole in the snow beside him that he had <strong>vomit</strong>ed, but he was unable to remember when.</p>

<p>"Novels\Sleeping Beauties.txt" 7801 452:Late Friday afternoon, well into the second day of the disaster (in Dooling, at least; in some parts of the world, it was already Aurora Day Three), Terry Coombs awoke to the aroma of sizzling bacon and brewing coffee. Terry's first coherent thought was: Is there any liquid left in the Squeaky Wheel, or did I drink the whole place, right down to the dishwater? His second was more basic: get to the bathroom. He did just that, arriving in time to <strong>vomit</strong> copiously into the toilet. For a couple of minutes he rested there, letting the pendulum that was making the room swing back and forth settle to a stop. When it did, he hauled himself up, found some Bayer and swallowed three with gulps of water from the faucet. Back in the bedroom, he stared at the space on the left side of the bed where he recalled that Rita had been lying, cocoon around her head, the white stuff in her mouth sucking inward and billowing out with each breath.</p>
<p>"Novels\Stand, The.txt" 223 310:"God-damn," Norm Bruett shouted, almost screamed. He turned away, clutched his ample belly, and was sick. It wasn't the man who had fallen out (Hap had caught him neatly before he could thump to the pavement) but the smell that was issuing from the car, a sick stench compounded of blood, fecal matter, <strong>vomit</strong>, and human decay. It was a ghastly rich sick-dead smell.</p>
<p>"Novels\Stand, The.txt" 7935 274:And it hit him right away after the fresh morning cleanness of the air outside; he must have been mostly asleep before to have missed it. The smell was not overpoweringly strong because the tent was fairly well ventilated, but it was strong enough: the sweet-sour smell of <strong>vomit</strong> and sickness.</p>
<p>"Novels\Stand, The.txt" 7937 193:"Rita?" He felt mounting alarm at the still way she was lying, just that dry fluff of her hair sticking out of the sleeping bag. He crawled toward her on his hands and knees, the smell of <strong>vomit</strong> stronger now, making his stomach knot. "Rita, you all right? Wake up, Rita!"</p>
<p>"Novels\Stand, The.txt" 11606 145:His laugh was half moan. She punctuated each of his elliptical sentences with "Yes, Glen," but he seemed not to hear. Glen smelled a trifle <strong>vomit</strong>ous. The butterflies banged against them and then banged off again on their butterfly errands. They were almost to the farmhouse. The battle had lasted less than a minute. Less than a minute, but she suspected it was going to be held over by popular demand inside her head. Glen patted her hand. She wanted to tell him to please stop doing that, but she was afraid that he might cry if she did. She could stand the patting. She wasn't sure she could stand to see Glen Bateman weeping.</p>

<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 2612 713:Once they were on the western side of the village, the wagon-traffic decreased, but the pedestrian traffic headed east increased dramatically. Most of the pedestrians were weaving, staggering, laughing. They all reeked of ale. In some cases, their clothes were dripping, as if they had lain full-length in it and drunk of it like dogs. Jack supposed they had. He saw a laughing man leading a laughing boy of perhaps eight by the hand. The man bore a nightmarish resemblance to the hateful desk clerk at the Alhambra, and Jack understood with perfect clarity that this man was that man's Twinner. Both he and the boy he led by the hand were drunk, and as Jack turned to look after them, the little boy began to <strong>vomit</strong>. His father-or so Jack supposed him to be-jerked him hard by the arm as the boy attempted to flounder his way into the brushy ditch, where he could be sick in relative privacy. The kid reeled back to his father like a curdog on a short leash, spraying puke on an elderly man who had collapsed by the side of the road and was snoring there.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 3224 73:The men's toilet was a horror. Earlier in the evening Jack might have <strong>vomit</strong>ed in sympathy, but now he actually seemed to be getting used to the stench . . . and that was somehow the worst thing of all. He drew hot water, dumped in Comet, and began to run his soapy mop back and forth through the unspeakable mess on the floor. His mind began to go back over the last couple of days, worrying at them the way an animal in a trap will worry at a limb that has been caught.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 3428 236:He managed to make it into the Tap's only stall, where he was faced with the unflushed and sickeningly fragrant spoor of the last customer. Jack <strong>vomit</strong>ed up whatever remained of his dinner, took a couple of hitching breaths, and then <strong>vomit</strong>ed again. He groped for the flush with a shaking hand and pushed it. Waylon and Willie thudded dully through the walls, singing about Luckenbach, Texas.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 3430 504:Suddenly his mother's face was before him, more beautiful than it had ever been on any movie screen, her eyes large and dark and sorrowing. He saw her alone in their rooms at the Alhambra, a cigarette smouldering forgotten in the ashtray beside her. She was crying. Crying for him. His heart seemed to hurt so badly that he thought he would die from love for her and want of her-for a life where there were no things in tunnels, no women who somehow wanted to be slapped and made to cry, no men who <strong>vomit</strong>ed between their own feet while taking a piss. He wanted to be with her and hated Speedy Parker with a black completeness for ever having set his feet on this awful road west.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 4071 514:This happened when he was six, and in the midst of his weightless tumble through limbo, it happened again-the horrible purple taste of Speedy's juice backed up into his mouth, into the passages behind his nose, and all of that languid afternoon of six years before replayed itself out in his mind. He saw it just as if the magic juice brought total recall, and so speedily that he lived through that afternoon in the same few seconds which told him that this time the magic juice really was going to make him <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 4083 1219:killed Jerry Bledsoe? The magic juice forced itself into the boy's mouth, stinging threads of it nauseatingly trickled into his nose, and just as Jack felt loose earth beneath his hands he gave up and <strong>vomit</strong>ed rather than drown. What killed Jerry Bledsoe? Foul purple stuff shot from Jack's mouth, choking him, and he blindly pushed himself backward-his feet and legs snagged in tall stiff weeds. Jack pushed himself up on his hands and knees and waited, patient as a mule, his mouth drooping open, for the second attack. His stomach clenched, and he did not have time to groan before more of the stinking juice burned up through his chest and throat and spattered out of his mouth. Ropey pink strings of saliva hung from his lips, and Jack feebly brushed them away. He wiped his hand on his pants. Jerry Bledsoe, yes. Jerry-who'd always had his name spelled out on his shirt, like a gas-station attendant. Jerry, who had died when-The boy shook his head and wiped his hands across his mouth again. He spat into a nest of saw-toothed wild grass sprouting like a giant's corsage out of the gray-brown earth. Some dim animal instinct he did not understand made him push loose earth over the pinkish pool of <strong>vomit</strong>. Another reflex made him brush the palms of his hands against his trousers. Finally he looked up.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 4637 74:Jack closed his eyes and steeled himself against the awful taste and the <strong>vomit</strong>ing that was apt to follow.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 4654 4:He <strong>vomit</strong>ed up a thin purple drool, his face only inches from the grass covering the long slope down to a four-lane highway; shook his head and rocked backward onto his knees, so that only his back was exposed to the heavy gray sky. The world, this world, stank. Jack pushed himself backward, away from the threads of puke settling over the blades of grass, and the stench altered but did not diminish. Gasoline, other nameless poisons floated in the air; and the air itself stank of exhaustion, fatigue-even the noises roaring up from the highway punished this dying air. The back end of a roadsign reared like a gigantic television screen over his head. Jack wobbled to his feet. Far down the other side of the highway glinted an endless body of water only slightly less gray than the sky. A sort of malignant luminescence darted across the surface. From here, too, rose an odor of metal filings and tired breath. Lake Ontario: and the snug little city down there might be Olcott or Kendall. He'd gone miles out of his way-lost a hundred miles or more and just about four and a half days. Jack stepped under the sign, hoping it was no worse than that. He looked up at the black letters. Wiped his mouth. ANGOLA. Angola? Where was that? He peered down at the smokey little city through the already nearly tolerable air.</p>

<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 6654 140:"Oh, Jeez," Jack groaned. The rabbit's stripped legs were disconcertingly human. Jack's stomach folded into itself. But instead of <strong>vomit</strong>ing, he laughed, startled by an absurd comparison. Wolf was like the family pet who each morning presents his owners with a dead bird, an eviscerated mouse.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 9230 171:As he bolted out of the common room, Peabody skidded in Pedersen's blood, went down to one knee, got up, and then ran down the first-floor hall as fast as he could go, <strong>vomit</strong>ing all over himself as he went. Kids were running everywhere, shrieking in panic. Peabody's own panic was not quite that complete. He remembered what he was supposed to do in extreme situations-although he didn't think anyone had ever envisioned a situation as extreme as this; he had an idea that Reverend Gardener had been thinking in terms of a kid going bugfuck and cutting another kid up, something like that.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 9281 277:"Wolf!" he cried, although the boys cringing in their hiding places on the first and second floors heard only a rising, triumphant howl. He raised both of the heavily muscled battering rams that had been his arms and drove them into the door. It burst open in the middle, <strong>vomit</strong>ing splinters down the stairwell. Wolf drove his way through, and yes, here was the narrow place, like a throat; here was the way to the place where the White Man had told his lies while Jack and the Weaker Wolf had to sit and listen.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 10459 404:The thing out there was short. It stood on the frost-whitened grass like a troll that had crawled out from under some bridge, its long-clawed hands hanging almost to its knees. It wore an Army duffel coat with ETHERIDGE stencilled above the left pocket. The jacket hung unzipped and open. Beneath it, Jack could see a torn and rumpled Pendleton shirt. A dark stain which might have been either blood or <strong>vomit</strong> was splashed over one side. It was wearing a rumpled blue tie with tiny gold upper-case E's woven into the rep fabric; a couple of burrs were stuck on it like grotesque tietacks.</p>

He swallowed, hard-it was like swallowing a pound of nails. "Please, God," he said aloud. The giant ball of light sped straight toward him, as though it owned a mind and had decided to erase Jack Sawyer and Richard Sloat from the earth. Radiation poisoning. Jack's stomach contracted, and his testicles froze up under his body. Radiation poisoning. <strong>vomit</strong>s and <strong>vomit</strong>s until his stomach ruptures . . .</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 12333 48:Richard groaned, and Jack feared that he would <strong>vomit</strong> all over both of them.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 13114 112:"If you make me seasick," Richard said, his voice jiggling in time with Jack's footfalls, "I'll just <strong>vomit</strong> on your head."</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 14547 276:He started forward and came within an inch of stepping right back through the trapdoor, like a kid participating in some bizarre double execution by hanging. Swing with a Friend, Jack thought crazily. His heart was hammering in his ears, and for a moment he thought he might <strong>vomit</strong> straight down into the gray water slapping at the pilings. Then he caught hold of himself and closed the trapdoor with his foot. Now there was only the sound of the weathervanes-cabalistic brass designs spinning restlessly in the sky.</p>
<p>"Novels\Talisman, The.txt" 15852 142:Most of the Wolfs who had stood up to the quake and rallied to Morgan were now reeling away, hands before their faces. A couple of them were <strong>vomit</strong>ing helplessly.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 2002 265:His stomach felt sour and bloated. His throat and sinuses were caked with elderly puke. He looked to his left, and sure enough, there it was, a little above him in what must have been his original position, the drinker's signature-a great big splash of drying <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 4671 334:The Rev. Mr. Hartley suddenly felt warm-much too warm. He felt, in fact, as though he might faint. He pushed his way through standing throngs of men in red-and-black-checked shirts and muddy flannel pants, through clouds of acrid smoke puffed from corncobs and cheap cigars. He still felt faint, but now he felt that he might also <strong>vomit</strong> before he fainted. A week later he would not be able to understand the depth of his shock, so deep it was really horror. A year later he would not even acknowledge that he had felt such an emotion.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 6188 700:He pulled over, scrambled out of his car, and threw up in the ditch. He stood trembling and weak-kneed over the mess (which contained one of his canines, although he was just then much too excited to realize he'd lost a tooth), his fingers itching to hold a piece of chalk, to cover a blackboard with sines and cosines. Visions of the Nobel Prize jittered in his overheated brain. He threw himself back into his car and began to drive toward Orono again, punching his rusty Subaru up to eighty. But by the time he got to Hampden, his glorious vision had clouded over, and by the time he reached Orono there was nothing left but a glimmer. He supposed it had been a momentary heat-stroke. Only the <strong>vomit</strong>ing had been real; that he could smell on his clothes. During the first day of the conference he was pale and silent, offering little, mourning his glorious ephemeral vision.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 8832 64:Ev jammed on the brakes. Dugan opened his door and leaned out, <strong>vomit</strong>ed a thin yellow stream onto the dirt, and then closed his eyes for a moment. The world was swooping and turning.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 9311 150:He managed to get off the porch and to walk shakily around the corner of the house, out of view of the road, before throwing up. He saw blood in the <strong>vomit</strong>, and wasn't surprised. This wasn't the first time, although there was more blood this time than ever before.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 11473 77:But it was sunset light. There was no denying it. She had felt better after <strong>vomit</strong>ing, yes . . . and she suddenly understood why. The knowledge had been there all along, really, just waiting to be noticed, like the patches of sweat under the arms of her dress, or that faint smell of drying urine. She had felt better because the period between closing the door and actually starting the car again hadn't been seconds or minutes, but hours-she had spent all that brutally hot summer day in the oven of the car. She had lain in a deathlike stupor, and if she had been using the Cutlass's air-conditioning with all the windows rolled up when she stopped the car, she would have cooked like a Thanksgiving turkey. But her sinuses were nearly as bad as her teeth, and the canned air manufactured by automobile air conditioners irritated them. This physical problem, she realized suddenly, staring at the old farm with wide, bloodshot eyes, had probably saved her life. She had been running with all four windows open. Otherwise-</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14089 87:The sling rose in the air and Gardener clung tightly to the cable, fighting a need to <strong>vomit</strong>-that need, he thought, was quickly going to become impossible to deny, but Bobbi had sent him a thought which came through loud and clear as soon as they wriggled out through the hatch again: Don't take the mask off until you get topside. Were Bobbi's thoughts clearer, or was it his imagination? No. Not imagination. They had both gotten another boost inside the ship. His nose was still bleeding and his shirt was sopping with it; the air mask was filling up. It was by far the worst nosebleed he'd had since Bobbi first brought him out here.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14107 69:He did it again, and realized he had never experienced this sort of <strong>vomit</strong>ing in his entire life. He had read about it, however. He was ejecting stuff-most of it bloody-in wads that flew like bullets. And bullets were almost what they were. He was having a seizure of projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing. This was not considered a sign of good health in medical circles.</p>

<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14117 47:The wavering gray mists cleared a little. The <strong>vomit</strong>ing subsided. He raised a hand to his face and flung away a sheet of blood with it.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14136 227:By the time they got back to the farm, Gardener was better. The bleeding from his nose had subsided to a trickle. He had swallowed a fair amount of blood while wearing the mouthpiece, and a lot of the blood he had seen in his <strong>vomit</strong> must have been that. He hoped.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14371 397:Gardener unscrewed the top of the Valium bottle, shook out half a dozen of the blue pills with the heart shape in the middle (Valentines from the Valley of Torpor, he thought), tossed them into his mouth, cracked the beer, and swallowed them. There went sixty milligrams down the old chute. He could have hidden one under his tongue, maybe, but six? Come on, folks, be real. Not much time now. I <strong>vomit</strong>ed my belly empty, I've lost a lot of blood, I haven't been taking this shit and so have no tolerance to it, I'm some thirty pounds lighter than I was when I picked up the first mandatory prescription. If I don't get rid of this shit quick, they'll hit me like a highballing semi.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14520 46:"His nose bled, his teeth fell out, he got <strong>vomit</strong>ing, and he was convinced that all of this was coming out of the air?"</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 14606 349:If it was, it was like no kind of radiation Torgeson had ever heard of-the Woolwich units had reported one-hundred-percent engine failure as they approached the Haven town line. China had sent a pumper and a tanker. The pumper quit on them, but the tanker kept running and the driver had somehow managed to reverse it out of the danger zone with <strong>vomit</strong>ing men stuffed into the cab, clinging to the bumpers, and spread-eagled on top of the tank. Most had nosebleeds; a few, ear-bleeds; one had a ruptured eye.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 15247 94:He retched, bringing up salt water dyed blue. He saw undissolved chunks of blue pills in the <strong>vomit</strong>us, as well. Some looked more or less intact. How many did she get me to take?</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 15249 96:Then he threw up again . . . again . . . again. It was an encore performance of the projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing in the woods-some overworked circuit in his brain persistently triggering the gag reflex, a deadly hiccuping that could kill.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 15265 349:He got to his knees, then managed to get to his feet with the help of the counter. He thought there was a box of No-Doz in the bathroom cabinet, but doubted if his stomach would hold them down after the latest insult he had dealt it. Under other circumstances it might have been worth the experiment, but Gardener was afraid that if the projectile <strong>vomit</strong>ing started again, it might not stop.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 15275 101:He put the back of his hand against his mouth. His stomach grunted. He shut his eyes and forced the <strong>vomit</strong>ing down before it could start.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 15760 515:Once, while in college, he had participated in something called the Great McDonald's Eat-Out. Five frats had fielded "champion eaters." Gard had been Delta Tau Delta's "champ." He had been on his sixth Big Mac-not even close to the contest winner's eventual total-and had become suddenly aware that he was very close to total physical overload. He had never felt anything like it in his life. In a gross way it was almost interesting. His midsection felt thundery with food. He did not feel like <strong>vomit</strong>ing; nausea did not exactly describe what it had been like. He saw his stomach as a huge, still dirigible lying bloated in still air at his center. He thought he could sense red lights going on in some mental Mission Control Center as various systems tried to deal with this insane load of meat, bread, and sauce. He didn't <strong>vomit</strong>. He walked it off. Very slowly, he walked it off. For hours he had felt like those drawings of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, his stomach stretched and smooth and terribly close to bursting.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 16258 348:The Tommyknockers, Bobbi had told Gardener, were great sky travelers. This was true. But never, anywhere, had they met anyone quite like this one man, who kept going, even with his shattered ankle, his great loss of blood, and his ingestion of a drug that should have rendered him unconscious fifteen minutes ago, in spite of the great lot he had <strong>vomit</strong>ed up.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 16484 99:Doggerel chiming in his head, Gardener crawled up the corridor, pausing once to turn his head and <strong>vomit</strong>. The air in here was still pretty fucking rank. He thought a miner's canary would already be lying at the bottom of its cage, alive but only by an inch or so.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 16690 106:He drifted down through black levels of unconsciousness, and shortly before the final <strong>vomit</strong>ing began-a <strong>vomit</strong>ing of which he was never even aware-he had a dream. A dream so real that he smiled as he lay in the middle of blackness, surrounded by space and with the earth below him like a giant blue-gray croaker marble.</p>
<p>"Novels\Tommyknockers, The.txt" 16819 373:The changed air was analyzed; the machine which manufactured it was carefully studied; the failing batteries were replaced. As Bobbi had suggested, it didn't take the braintrusters long to understand the mechanics of the device, and the underlying principles were already being studied at MIT, Cal Tech, Bell Labs, and the Shop in Virginia by scientists who were nearly <strong>vomit</strong>ing with excitement.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 345 20:He leaned down and <strong>vomit</strong>ed into the running water. The sundapples on the water were malicious, awful. Then his vision cleared enough so he could see the Peace Bridge to his right. The fisherboys were gone, but as he looked, a pair of police cars raced down Town Common Hill.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 5906 276:"The Dome," Frankie said. "And I don't appreciate your mouth." He took a long step forward and punched the current guest editor of Ploughshares in the gut. Thurston made a hoarse whoofing sound, doubled over, staggered, almost kept his feet, went to his knees, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed up about a teacup's worth of thin white gruel that still smelled of Brie.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 10113 469:After three twists of the old-fashioned crank doorbell, Brenda resigned herself to going home after all. She was turning away when she heard slow, shuffling steps approaching the door. She arranged a little Hello, neighbor smile on her face. It froze there when she saw Andrea-cheeks pale, dark circles under her eyes, hair in disarray, cinching the belt of a bathrobe around her middle, pajamas underneath. And this house smelled, too-not of decaying meat but of <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 11298 92:"Not right away." Junior gave Randolph a frank stare. "First I had to go outside and <strong>vomit</strong>. They were beaten up so bad. I never saw anything like that in my life." He let out a long sigh, being careful to put a small tremble in it. The tape recorder probably wouldn't pick up that tremble, but Randolph would remember it. "When I was done heaving, that was when I called Dad."</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 13753 273:"Well call somebody, for the love of Jesus, and find out if we're supposed to do anything before we clean up the mess. Take photographs, or I don't know what. Not that there's much doubt about what happened. You'll have to excuse me for a minute. I'm going to <strong>vomit</strong>."</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 13871 16:"Don't you <strong>vomit</strong>, Linny," Rusty said, and went across to the cabinets on the far side of the room. The first drawer he opened contained nothing but stacked back issues of Field & Stream, and he cursed. The one under it, however, had what he needed. He reached beneath a trocar that looked as if it had never been washed and pulled out a pair of green plastic face masks still in their wrappers. He handed one mask to Linda, donned the other himself. He looked into the next drawer and appropriated a pair of rubber gloves. They were bright yellow, hellishly jaunty.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 14207 192:It was gloomy in the living room, but not entirely dark; Andi had left a battery-powered lamp on in the kitchen. And there was a smell. The windows were open, but with no breeze, the odor of <strong>vomit</strong> hadn't entirely vented. Had someone told her that Andrea was ill? With the flu, maybe?</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 19468 186:"Yes," Barbie agreed, "but does that mean that what the Geiger counter's registering is dangerous? Rusty and the kids aren't breaking out in lesions, or losing their hair, or <strong>vomit</strong>ing up the linings of their stomachs."</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 20432 89:He knelt at the toilet, grasping what he and Rory had called Grampy's crip-rails, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. When it was out of him, he flushed (thanks to the gennie and a good deep well, he could flush), lowered the lid, and sat on it, trembling all over. Beside him, in the sink, were two of Grampy Tom's pill bottles and a bottle of Jack Daniels. All the bottles were empty. Ollie picked up one of the pill bottles. PERCOCET, the label said. He didn't bother with the other one.</p>
<p>"Novels\Under the Dome.txt" 23512 44:Ollie began coughing, then leaned over and <strong>vomit</strong>ed weakly. Ames held him while he did it. The others were running toward them now, shouting jubilantly, Sergeant Groh in the forefront.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Long Walk, The.txt" 528 456:Stebbins stepped over the body. His foot slid a little in some of the blood, and his next step with that foot left a bloody track, like a photograph in an Official Detective magazine. Stebbins didn't look down at what was left of Curley. His face didn't change expression. Stebbins, you bastard, Garraty thought, you were supposed to get your ticket first, didn't you know? Then Garraty looked away. He didn't want to be sick. He didn't want to <strong>vomit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Long Walk, The.txt" 1034 92:No one replied. Harkness looked ashamed and began to polish his glasses again. The boy who <strong>vomit</strong>ed was not shot.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Long Walk, The.txt" 3815 255:"Oh my God," Abraham said, and turned to Garraty with his hands cupped over his mouth. Abraham's face was white and cheesy. His eyes were bulging. His eyes were frantic with terror. "Oh my God, Ray, what a fucking gross-out, oh Jesus!" Abraham <strong>vomit</strong>ed. Puke sprayed through his fingers.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Long Walk, The.txt" 3875 460:McVries laughed wildly. "Here we are, here we are and you want to know what's eating me! I'm worried about next year's income taxes, that's what's eating me. I'm worried about the price of grain in South Dakota, that's what's eating me. Olson, his guts were falling out, Garraty, at the end he was walking with his guts falling out, and that's eating me, that's eating me-" He broke off and Garraty watched him struggle to keep from <strong>vomit</strong>ing. Abruptly McVries said, "Scramm's poor."</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Rage.txt 993 528:She screamed-what a fright it can give you when a grown-up screams!-and ran over and put her finger down Herk's throat. Herk threw up the mouse, the hamburger he'd eaten for lunch, and some pasty glop that looked like tomato soup. He was just starting to ask his mother what was going on when she threw up. And there, in all that puke, that old dead mouse didn't look bad at all. It sure looked better than the rest of the stuff. The moral seemed to be that puking up your past when the present is even worse makes some of the <strong>vomit</strong>us look nearly tasty. I started to tell them that, and then decided it would only revolt them-like the story of the Cherokee Nose Job.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Rage.txt 1943 1843:My hands had begun to tremble. My stomach really did hurt. I've always had a lousy stomach. Sometimes I'd get the dry heaves before I went to school in the morning, or when I was taking a girl out for the first time. Once, Joe and I took a couple of girls down to Harrison State Park. It was July, warm and very beautiful. The sky had a dim, very high haze. The girl I was with was named Annmarie. She spelled it all one name. She was very pretty. She wore dark green corduroy shorts and a silk pullover blouse. She had a beach bag. We were going down Route 1 toward Bath, the radio on and playing good rock 'n' roll. Brian Wilson, I remember that, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. And Joe was driving his old blue Mercury-he used to call it De Blue Frawwwg and then grin his Joe McKennedy grin. All the vents were open. I got sick to my stomach. It was very bad. Joe was talking to his girl. They were talking about surfing, which was certainly compatible with the Beach Boys on the radio. She was a fine-looking girl. Her name was Rosalynn. She was Annmarie's sister. I opened my mouth to say I felt sick, and puked all over the floor. Some of it got on Annmarie's leg, and the look on her face, you couldn't imagine it. Or maybe you could. They all tried to make light of it, brush it off. I let all my guys puke on me on the first date, ha-ha. I couldn't go in swimming that day. My stomach felt too bad. Annmarie sat on the blanket next to me most of the time and got a burn. The girls had packed a picnic lunch. I drank a soda, but I couldn't eat any of the sandwiches. I was thinking about Joe's blue Mere, standing in the sun all day, and how it was going to smell going home. The late Lenny Bruce once said you can't get snot off a suede jacket, and to that I would add one of the other great home truths: you can't get the smell of <strong>vomit</strong> out of a blue Mercury's upholstery. It's there for weeks, for months, maybe years. And it smelled just about like I thought it would. Everybody just pretended it wasn't there. But it was.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 384 296:Screams from behind him. He turned and saw the Reed twins, their faces very pale beneath their summer tans, looking past their dog to the boy crumpled on his lawn. The twin with the blond hair-Jim, he thought-began to cry. The other one took a step backward, grimaced, then bent forward and <strong>vomit</strong>ed onto his own bare feet.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 737 143:Of course you know why, she told herself. There's a body down there, all right, there really is, and Davey Reed <strong>vomit</strong>ed at the sight of it. <strong>vomit</strong>ed and got some on himself, poor kid.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 1314 612:Now he was in a dark hall, just happy to realize he hadn't wet his pants, or worse. People were screaming somewhere behind him. Mounted on the wall was a jury of Hummel figures. They had been placed on little platforms . . . and the Carvers had seemed so normal in other respects, he thought. He started to giggle and shoved the heel of one hand against his lips to stifle the sound. This was definitely not a giggling situation. There was a taste on his skin, just the taste of his own sweat, of course, but for a moment it seemed almost to be the taste of pussy, and he leaned forward, sure he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. He realized he would almost certainly pass out if he did and that thought helped him to control the urge. He took his hand away from his mouth, and that helped more. He no longer felt much like laughing, either, and that was probably good.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 3943 69:Smells like he shit his pants, Dave thought, and suddenly felt like <strong>vomit</strong>ing. He controlled it. He didn't want to <strong>vomit</strong> again, even in a dream.</p>

<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 4294 687:There was fresh chocolate milk on the top shelf. Tak took the tall white Tupperware pitcher out with Seth's grimy hands, set it on the counter, then inspected the contents of the meat drawer. There was hamburger, but it didn't know how to cook and there was certainly no information on the subject stored in Seth's memory-banks. Tak had no objection to raw meat-liked it, in fact-but on two or three occasions, eating hamburger that way had made Seth's body ill. At least Aunt Audrey said it was the raw meat which had made him sick, and Tak didn't think she was lying (although with Aunt Audrey, it could never be completely sure). The last go-round had been the worst-<strong>vomit</strong>ing and shitting all night long. Tak had vacated the premises until it was over, just checking in every now and then to make sure there was no funny stuff going on. It hated Seth's eliminatory functions even when they were normal, and on that night they had been anything but.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 4506 385:I couldn't resist shining my light into that crack once before we went, though. When I bent down I could feel air rushing out, so it wasn't just a crack in the slide; there was some sort of rift on the other side of it. Maybe a cave. The air coming out was as hot as air coming out of a furnace grate, and it stank something fierce. One whiff and I held my breath so I wouldn't <strong>vomit</strong>. It was the old-campfire smell, but a thousand times heavier. I've racked my brains trying to think of how something that deep underground could smell so bad, and keep coming up empty. Fresh air is the only thing that makes things stink like that, and that means some sort of vent, but Deep Earth has been burrowing in these parts ever since 1957, and if there had been a vent big enough to manufacture a stench like that, surely it would've been found and either plugged or followed to see where it went.</p>
<p>"Novels\Bachman\Regulators, The.txt" 5277 310:In the bathroom adjacent to the kitchen, it can hear the boy. The boy is making the low, piggy grunting sounds Tak has come to associate with its elimination function. For Tak, even the sounds are revolting, and the act itself, with its cramping and its sensations of sliding, helpless exit, is hideous. Even <strong>vomit</strong>ing is better-it's quick, at least, up the throat and gone.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Roadwork.txt 3762 188:She fled. The room was horribly quiet for what seemed like eternity. Then the talk picked up again. He looked down at his dripping half-eaten hamburger, trembling, afraid he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. When he knew he was not, he paid the check and left without looking around.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Roadwork.txt 4053 478:He put on his coat and hat and gloves in the kitchen entry, and paused for a moment. He went back through the warmly lighted house and looked at it-the kitchen table, the stove, the dining room bureau with the teacups hung from the runner above it, the African violet on the mantel in the living room-he felt a warm surge of love for it, a surge of protectiveness. He thought of the wrecking ball roaring through it, belting the walls down to junk, shattering the windows, <strong>vomit</strong>ing debris over the floors. He wasn't going to let that happen. Charlie had crawled on these floors, had taken his first steps in the living room, had once fallen down the front stairs and scared the piss out of his fumbling parents. Charlie's room was now an upstairs study, but it was in there that his son had first felt the headaches and experienced the double vision and smelled those odd aromas, sometimes like roasting pork, sometimes like burning grass, sometimes like pencil shavings. After Charlie had died, almost a hundred people had come to see them, and Mary had served them cake and pie in the living room.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Roadwork.txt 4210 172:The water for the coffee was boiling. He set the radio to one of the pop stations and brought his coffee back to the table and drank it black. There was an inclination to <strong>vomit</strong> with the first two mouthfuls, but after that it was better.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Roadwork.txt 4782 184:All of it was inside him, but he had been honestly unaware that his thoughts were changing him so deeply, so irretrievably. And now it was all out in the open, like some obscene mess <strong>vomit</strong>ed onto a coffee table, reeking with stomach juice, filled with undigested lumps, and if the world was only a demo derby, wouldn't one be justified in stepping out of his car? But what after that? Life seemed only a preparation for hell.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 595 187:Heidi had observed this ritual, and she had once sarcastically asked him if he wouldn't like an ostrich feather for his birthday. Then, she said, he could stick it down his throat and <strong>vomit</strong> once or twice before weighing himself. Billy told her not to be a wise-ass . . . and later that night had found himself musing that the idea actually had its attractions.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 1133 125:He felt his stomach roll over in a single giddy tumble, and for one desperate moment it seemed impossible that he would not <strong>vomit</strong>. He struggled grimly to keep his supper down-he needed that nourishment, those warm healthy calories.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 1389 99:Leda clapped both hands over her mouth and then excused herself as if she had burped-or perhaps <strong>vomit</strong>ed-instead of laughed. Billy, incapable of speaking just then, only nodded and got up to make himself a fresh drink after all.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 3033 28:Grimly battling an urge to <strong>vomit</strong> precious calories over the rail-he had never been much of a sailor-Billy rode the inter-island ferry from Owl's Head to Vinalhaven, but the Gypsies had not been there either.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 3187 96:The smells in the air had been pizza, ice cream, frying onions, every now and then the nervous <strong>vomit</strong> of some little kid who had stayed on the Tilt-A-Whirl too long. Most of the cars which cruised slowly up and down in the bumper-to-bumper Old Orchard traffic had been old, rusty around the bottoms of the doors, and usually too big. Many of them had been blowing oil.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 4243 193:"Christ," Billy said, and groped for the laced coffee. He got the cup to his mouth and then set it back down again. If he drank any of that, he was going to <strong>vomit</strong>. He couldn't afford to <strong>vomit</strong>. In his mind's eye he could see Spurton sitting behind the Ford's wheel, head tilted back, a dark hole over one eye, a ball of white feathers in his lap. This vision was clear enough so he could even see the bird's yellow beak, frozen half-open, its glazed black eyes . . .</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 4509 286:"Yeah, I heard what you said." He worked his way out. Ginelli guessed he was forty-five but he looked older, an extremely tall man who slumped so badly that he looked almost deformed. He wore a Disney World T-shirt and huge baggy Bermuda shorts. He smelled of Thunderbird wine and <strong>vomit</strong> waiting to happen. He looked like the sort of man to whom it happened fairly often. Like three and four times a week. Ginelli thought he recognized him from the night before-it had either been this guy or there was another Gypsy around here who went six-four or six-five. He had been one of those bounding away with all the grace of a blind epileptic having a heart attack, he told Billy.</p>
<p>Novels\Bachman\Thinner.txt 5175 193:"You bet," Billy said. "That's what it's all about, isn't it? Just driving through and trying to pick up your order." He laughed again. He felt simultaneously very fine and like <strong>vomit</strong>ing.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower I The Gunslinger.txt" 487 1003:"He died right in front of this place," she said. "Came clumping down the boardwalk-his boots wouldn't wear out, they were engineer boots he found in the old train-yard-with the children and dogs behind him. He looked like wire clothes hangers all wrapped and twirled together. You could see all the lights of hell in his eyes, but he was grinning, just like the grins the children carve into their sharproots and pumpkins, come Reap. You could smell the dirt and the rot and the weed. It was running down from the corners of his mouth like green blood. I think he meant to come in and listen to Sheb play the piano. And right in front, he stopped and cocked his head. I could see him, and I thought he heard a coach, although there was none due. Then he puked, and it was black and full of blood. It went right through that grin like sewer water through a grate. The stink was enough to make you want to run mad. He raised up his arms and just threw over. That was all. He died in his own <strong>vomit</strong> with that grin on his face."</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower II The Drawing of the Three.txt" 524 140:Then, after he'd given his order and the stewardess had left, he started to feel like he was maybe going to <strong>vomit</strong>. Not for sure going to <strong>vomit</strong>, only maybe, but it was better to be safe. Going through Customs with a pound of pure cocaine under each armpit with gin on your breath was not so good; going through Customs that way with puke drying on your pants would be disaster. So better to be safe. The feeling would probably pass, it usually did, but better to be safe.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower II The Drawing of the Three.txt" 579 30:When the prisoner's fit of <strong>vomit</strong>ing had passed, the gunslinger leaped forward-this time all the way to the front. He understood very little about this strange situation, and to act in a situation one does not understand is to invite the most terrible consequences, but there were two things he needed to know-and he needed to know them so desperately that the needing outweighed any consequences which might arise.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower II The Drawing of the Three.txt" 4203 4739:She could remember the china plate. She could remember that. She could remember slipping it into the pocket of her dress, looking over her shoulder all the while to make sure the Blue Woman wasn't there, peeking. She had to make sure because the china plate belonged to the Blue Woman. The china plate was, Detta understood in some vague way, a forspecial. Detta took it for that why. Detta remembered taking it to a place she knew (although she didn't know how she knew) as The Drawers, a smoking trash-littered hole in the earth where she had once seen a burning baby with plastic skin. She remembered putting the plate carefully down on the gravelly ground and then starting to step on it and stopping, remembered taking off her plain cotton panties and putting them into the pocket where the plate had been, and then carefully slipping the first finger of her left hand carefully against the cut in her at the place where Old Stupid God had joined her and all other girlsandwomen imperfectly, but something about that place must be right, because she remembered the jolt, remembered wanting to press, remembered not pressing, remembered how delicious her vagina had been naked, without the cotton panties in the way of it and the world, and she had not pressed, not until her shoe pressed, her black patent leather shoe, not until her shoe pressed down on the plate, then she pressed on the cut with her finger the way she was pressing on the Blue Woman's forspecial china plate with her foot, she remembered the way the black patent leather shoe covered the delicate blue webbing on the edge of the plate, she remembered the press, yes, she remembered pressing in The Drawers, pressing with finger and foot, remembered the delicious promise of finger and cut, remembered that when the plate snapped with a bitter brittle snap a similar brittle pleasure had skewered upward from that cut into her guts like an arrow, she remembered the cry which had broken from her lips, an unpleasant cawing like the sound of a crow scared up from a cornpatch, she could remember staring dully at the fragments of the plate and then taking the plain white cotton panties slowly out of her dress pocket and putting them on again, step-ins, so she had heard them called in some time unhoused in memory and drifting loose like turves on a floodtide, step-ins, good, because first you stepped out to do your business and then you stepped back in, first one shiny patent leather shoe and then the other, good, panties were good, she could remember drawing them up her legs so clearly, drawing them past her knees, a scab on the left one almost ready to fall off and leave clean pink new babyskin, yes, she could remember so clearly it might not have been a week ago or yesterday but only one single moment ago, she could remember how the waistband had reached the hem of her party dress, the clear contrast of white cotton against brown skin, like cream, yes, like that, cream from a pitcher caught suspended over coffee, the texture, the panties disappearing under the hem of the dress, except then the dress was burnt orange and the panties were not going up but down but they were still white but not cotton, they were nylon, cheap see-through nylon panties, cheap in more ways than one, and she remembered stepping out of them, she remembered how they glimmered on the floormat of the '46 Dodge DeSoto, yes, how white they were, how cheap they were, not anything dignified like underwear but cheap panties, the girl was cheap and it was good to be cheap, good to be on sale, to be on the block not even like a whore but like a good breed-sow; she remembered no round china plate but the round white face of a boy, some surprised drunk fraternity boy, he was no china plate but his face was as round as the Blue Woman's china plate had been, and there was webbing on his cheeks, and this webbing looked as blue as the webbing on the Blue Woman's forspecial china plate had been, but that was only because the neon was red, the neon was garish, in the dark the neon from the roadhouse sign made the spreading blood from the places on his cheeks where she had clawed him look blue, and he had said Why did you why did you why did you do, and then he unrolled the window so he could get his face outside to puke and she remembered hearing Dodie Stevens on the jukebox, singing about tan shoes with pink shoelaces and a big Panama with a purple hatband, she remembered the sound of his puking was like gravel in a cement mixer, and his penis, which moments before had been a livid exclamation point rising from the tufted tangle of his pubic hair, was collapsing into a weak white question mark; she remembered the hoarse gravel sounds of his <strong>vomit</strong>ing stopped and then started again and she thought Well I guess he ain't made enough to lay this foundation yet and laughing and pressing her finger (which now came equipped with a long shaped nail) against her vagina which was bare but no longer bare because it was overgrown with its own coarse briared tangle, and there had been the same brittle breaking snap inside her, and it was still as much pain as it was pleasure (but better, far better, than nothing at all), and then he was grabbing blindly for her and saying in a hurt breaking tone Oh you goddamned nigger cunt and she went on laughing just the same, dodging him easily and snatching up her panties and opening the door on her side of the car, feeling the last blind thud of his fingers on the back of her blouse as she ran into a May night that was redolent of early honeysuckle, red-pink neon light stuttering off the gravel of some postwar parking lot, stuffing her panties, her cheap slick nylon panties not into the pocket of her dress but into a purse jumbled with a teenager's cheerful conglomeration of cosmetics, she was running, the light was stuttering, and then she was twenty-three and it was not panties but a rayon scarf, and she was casually slipping it into her purse as she walked along a counter in the Nice Notions section of Macy's-a scarf which sold at that time for $1.99.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 2575 622:Watching Roland make the introductions (Susannah was presented dead last, after Jake, and almost negligently), she had time to reflect on how fine she felt now that the nagging gas-pains in her left side had departed. Hell, even the lingering headache had gone its way, and that sucker had been hanging around-sometimes in the back of her head, sometimes at one temple or the other, sometimes just above her left eye, like a migraine waiting to hatch-for a week or more. And of course there were the mornings. Every one found her feeling nauseated and with a bad case of jelly-leg for the first hour or so.

"It's as good a name as any, I guess, although the first thing I think of when I hear that word is a kind of diet candy. You may know it doesn't always spread fast, but in my friend's case, it moved like a fire in straw. By mid-May of 1976, Lupe Delgado was very ill. He lost his color. He was feverish a lot of the time. He'd sometimes spend the whole night in the bathroom, <strong>vomit</strong>ing. Rowan would have banned him from the kitchen, but he didn't need to-Lupe banned himself. And then the blemishes began to show up."</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower V Wolves of the Calla.txt" 6285 1291:Picking oranges in Florida. Pushing a broom in New Orleans. Mucking out horse-stalls in Lufkin, Texas. Handing out real estate brochures on streetcorners in Phoenix, Arizona. Working jobs that pay cash. Observing the ever-changing faces on the bills. Noting the different names in the papers. Jimmy Carter is elected President, but so are Ernest "Fritz" Hollings and Ronald Reagan. George Bush is also elected President. Gerald Ford decides to run again and he is elected President. The names in the papers (those of the celebrities change the most frequently, and there are many he has never heard of) don't matter. The faces on the currency don't matter. What matters is the sight of a weathervane against a violent pink sunset, the sound of his heels on an empty road in Utah, the sound of the wind in the New Mexico desert, the sight of a child skipping rope beside a junked-out Chevrolet Caprice in Fossil, Oregon. What matters is the whine of the powerlines beside Highway 50 west of Elko, Nevada, and a dead crow in a ditch outside Rainbarrel Springs. Sometimes he's sober and sometimes he gets drunk. Once he lays up in an abandoned shed-this is just over the California state line from Nevada-and drinks for four days straight. It ends with seven hours of off-and-on <strong>vomit</strong>ing. For the first hour or so, the puking is so constant and so violent he is convinced it will kill him. Later on, he can only wish it would. And when it's over, he swears to himself that he's done, no more booze for him, he's finally learned his lesson, and a week later he's drunk again and staring up at the strange stars behind the restaurant where he has hired on as a dishwasher. He is an animal in a trap and he doesn't care. Sometimes there are vampires and sometimes he kills them. Mostly he lets them live, because he's afraid of drawing attention to himself-the attention of the low men. Sometimes he asks himself what he thinks he's doing, where the hell he's going, and such questions are apt to send him in search of the next bottle in a hurry. Because he's really not going anywhere. He's just following the highways in hiding and dragging his trap along behind him, he's just listening to the call of those roads and going from one to the next. Trapped or not, sometimes he is happy; sometimes he sings in his chains like the sea. He wants to see the next weathervane standing against the next pink sunset. He wants to see the next silo crumbling at the end of some disappeared farmer's long-abandoned north field and see the next droning truck with TONOPAH GRAVEL or ASPLUNDH HEAVY CONSTRUCTION written on the side. He's in hobo heaven, lost in the split personalities of America. He wants to hear the wind in canyons and know that he's the only one who hears it. He wants to scream and hear the echoes run away. When the taste of Barlow's blood is too strong in his mouth, he wants to drink. And, of course, when he sees the lost-pet posters or the messages chalked on the sidewalks, he wants to move on. Out west he sees fewer of them, and neither his name nor his description is on any of them. From time to time he sees vampires cruising-give us this day our daily blood-but he leaves them be. They're mosquitoes, after all, no more than that.</p>

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower VI Song of Susannah.txt" 5361 255:Eddie stopped. Roland fumbled at the door-handle on his side, couldn't make it work, levered himself out the window all the way to his waist instead (Eddie heard the chink his belt buckle made on the chrome strip which faced the window-well), and then <strong>vomit</strong>ed onto the oggan.

<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower VII The Dark Tower.txt" 192 1190:One of them darted forward nevertheless, a deformed skeleton in an ancient, moss-encrusted dinner suit. Around its neck it wore some sort of ancient award . . . the Cross of Malta, perhaps? It swiped one of its long-nailed hands at the crucifix Callahan was holding out. He jerked it down at the last second, and the vampire's claw passed an inch above it. Callahan lunged forward without thought and drove the tip of the cross into the yellow parchment of the thing's forehead. The gold crucifix went in like a red-hot skewer into butter. The thing in the rusty dinner suit let out a liquid cry of pained dismay and stumbled backward. Callahan pulled his cross back. For one moment, before the elderly monster clapped its claws to its brow, Callahan saw the hole his cross had made. Then a thick, curdy, yellow stuff began to spill through the ancient one's fingers. Its knees unhinged and it tumbled to the floor between two tables. Its mates shrank away from it, screaming with outrage. The thing's face was already collapsing inward beneath its twisted hands. Its aura whiffed out like a candle and then there was nothing but a puddle of yellow, liquefying flesh spilling like <strong>vomit</strong> from the sleeves of its jacket and the legs of its pants.</p>
<p>"Novels\Dark Tower\The Dark Tower VII The Dark Tower.txt" 3328 208:The man had been quasi-immortal (a phrase at least as foolish as "most unique") and made a legendary meal.

He staggered two steps into the screaming blizzard, bent forward with his hands placed on his lower thighs, and <strong>vomit</strong>ed. She saw the jet of egested material, and how the wind whipped it away into the dark. When Roland came back in, his shirt and the side of his face were rimed with snow. It was fiercely hot in the cottage; that was something else Dandelo's glammer had hidden from them until now. She saw that the thermostat-a plain old Honeywell not much different from the one in her New York apartment-was still on the wall. She went to it and examined it. It was twisted as far as it would go, beyond the eighty-five-degree mark. She pushed it back to seventy with the tip of a finger, then turned to survey the room. The fireplace was actually twice the size it had appeared to them, and filled with enough logs to make it roar like a steel-furnace.
