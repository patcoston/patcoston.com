<strong>The History of The Long Walk&reg;</strong>

"May we never forget the horrors of war"

The Long Walk began in 1957, two years after the end of World War II in 1955
as a way to remember the horrors of war and honor those who died through the
recreation of the German Death March which lasted 6 days back in Dec of 1954.
After the destruction of the German nuclear base in Santiago in 1953, the German's
retaliated with an air-blitz of the American East Coast which lead to many American prisoners.
Prisoners were made to walk non-stop from the prisoner camp in Van Buren, MN to their base in Boston, MA.
Roughly 900 prisoners started but only one prisoner, Richard Harrington, was able to walk the full distance.
Dozens did escape. Men leading the pack, were able to slip into the Hainesville Woods
during a heavy snow-storm, when visibility made it impossible to see the Vanguard.
The Germans did not have the advanced technology that we enjoy today in 1979.

A halftrack followed the group at 3 mph.
Prisoners were made to march in rows of 10.
If prisoners fell behind the halftrack, they were shot.
If prisoners tried to escape by running off the road, they were shot.
If prisoners tried to attack the German soldiers, they were shot.

The Long Walk has become the national past-time, with TV coverage and billions bet every year.
Originally there was no money or prize, and any male of military-age could volunteer.

The tradition of the Vanguard was in honor of those men leading the pack who escaped.
The tradition remains, and boys still surge ahead to lead the pack in the Vanguard,
even though the faster walkers tend to burn out earlier.
Statistics shows that the slower walkers at the back of the pack tend to win.
But boys surge ahead thinking it gives them a psychological advantage to be leading.
They also avoid seeing most of the death that happens behind them.

<strong>1957:</strong> The low speed cutoff was 2 mph and there was a finish line in Boston.
The Long Walk would end before Boston if there was only one walker left.
Those who fell behind the pace-car traveling at 2 mph,
took their own lives by swallowing a suicide-pill that gave them a painless death.
It was the same suicide-pill developed by NASA and used by the crew of the first moon-landing
of Apollo 11 in 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin crashed into the west-crater boulder-field,
after the lander's flight-computer malfunctioned and failed to surrender manual-control.
About 10% of the walkers would opt-out of suicide when the time came.
There was no prize, except for their lives if they survived.
55 men volunteered for the first Long Walk and 4 made it to Boston.
The entire walk was televised live.

<strong>1958:</strong> Long Walk&reg; Corporation was formed.
To increase attendance, they offered a cash-prize of $99,999.99, and legal gambling was setup to fund the prize money. 
LWC also increased the low speed cutoff to 3 mph, to be more in line with history.
To increase realism to match history, each walker carried a gun and shot themselves if they fell behind the pace-car.
They were instructed on the proper technique, so their death would be quick, painless and permanent.
About 25% of the walkers would opt-out of suicide when the time came.
It was televised live from Caribou on.
There was only 1 survivor since none made it to Boston.
No walk to present day has made it to Boston since increasing low-speed cut-off 3 mph.

<a name="squads"></a>
<strong>1966:</strong> The Long Walk&reg; was becoming an international phenomenon and accredited for improving the Gross National Product and improving the economy.
The government took control of the Long Walk&reg; Corporation, and it became the Department of The Long Walk, under the control of the Squads.
Execution of walkers was also now handled by the soldiers to be more in line with history.
There would be no opt-outs which was more in line with the horrors of war, which was the point of the Long Walk.
It was televised live from the Hainesville Woods at the 90-mile mark to remember those men who escaped.
7 members of the Vanguard tried to recreate the escape but were unsuccessful.

<strong>1968:</strong> DoTLW increased the prize money to $999,9999.99, just one penny short of one-million, since millionaires are no longer allowed.
The numbers of volunteers each year had dropped below fifty, so they instituted a voluntary National Lottery to pick 50 boys between
the ages of 15 and 17. 25 Prime-Walkers, 25 Backups. Allowing those with second thoughts to backout, narrowed the field down to those with more commitment.
It was televised live starting from the 100-mile mark.

<strong>1970:</strong> DoTLW increased low speed cutoff to 4 mph and expanded the age range to be from 14 to 18.
The lottery now selected 100 names from the drum, 50 Prime-Walkers and 50 Backups.
A physical and mental test was added to filter out the weak. It became a source of pride if previous records were broken for example
the longest a full complement of walkers has walked, the highest complement of walkers to reach 100-mile mark, and the longest distance
traveled. Boys were chosen based on their ability to go beyond the walkers from the previous years.

<strong>1971:</strong> DoTLW expanded the age range to be from 13 to 18.
The lottery now selected 200 names from the drum. 100 Prime-Walkers and 100 Backups.

<strong>1974:</strong> The finish line in Boston was removed since it's believed to be an impossible finish line.
The route was extended to the very end of Route 1 in Key West, Florida. This is the new finish line which is humanly impossible reach given the constraints.
The Vegas Gambling commission still allows people to place bets on the walk reaching the old Boston finish line with 1000 to 1 odds.

<strong>1978:</strong> Besides the money, the winner also gets a prize. They can have whatever they want for the rest of their life.

<strong>Trivia:</strong>

* Two billion dollars gets bet on The Long Walk&reg; every year.
* Only six Long Walks in history have ended over the state line in New Hampshire.
* Only one Long Walk has crossed the state line into Massachusetts. That was seventeen years ago. The experts say this distance will never be beat.
* No long walks have made it to Boston.
* The longest distance a full complement of walkers has ever covered is seven and three-quarters miles.
* The shortest distance a full complement of walkers has ever covered is zero miles when a walker froze at the start last year.
* The largest complement of walkers to reach 100 miles since they increased the number of walkers to 100 in 1971, is 61 that same year.
* The only boy to finish The Long Walk&reg; from Maine was Reggie Cotter, nineteen years ago.
* Reggie cotter hemorrhaged in one eye and finished The Long Walk&reg; half-blind.
* Reggie Cotter died a week after winning the Walk from a blood clot on his brain.
* Lisbon Street in Lewiston was renamed to Cotter Memorial Avenue.
* There is only one boy from Maine this year: Raymond Garraty #47, 73rd out of the drum.
* Most winners of the Long-Walk die within a year.
* The walk stops on average about once every eleven years due to washed out bridges.
* The longest a walk was stopped was for five hours while the bridge was repaired. In that case, the bridge was destroyed by an anti-walk group in protest.
* Most long-walks last five days, but a few have finished after four days, and one lasted three days, twenty-seven years ago.
* The record for highest backouts was also the shortest walk, twenty-seven years ago. All 100 Prime-Walkers backed and nineteen backups, backed out,
  so the walk that year only had 81 backups. It's the only year there were less than 100 in The Long Walk&reg;,
  except of course for the first Long Walk which only had 50.
* The walkers ages range from 13 to 18.
* Most boys in the age range apply (about 20 million), but only 1 in 50 passes the physical, mental and essay test, leaving 40,000 for the lottery.
* 200 are selected randomly from the lottery during the TV spectacular where the Major randomly chooses the names from a large drum.
* Walkers do not know if they are Prime-Walkers or Backups until they get the call May 31, the day before The Long Walk&reg;.
* If they are one of the chosen 200, they can backout on April 15 and April 31 by calling the 800 number.
* If they are 18 years old, and backout, they get squaded.
* Most of the boys that backout are married.
* Brothers have been on different Long Walks, but never at the same time.
  This year we have the Quochytewa brothers from New Mexico whose nicknames are Joe and Mike.
  They are Backups 7 and 8, and 5th and 197th out of the drum.
* 10 walkers backout each year on average.
* 5 backouts gets squaded each year on average.
* This year, 12 backed out. 7 were Prime-Walkers and 5 were Backups.
* Soldiers on The Long Walk&reg; are chosen from those who got squaded for backing out.
* Soldiers are trained to show no emotion.
* The heavier walkers tend to get their ticket before the lighter walkers, but this year the Vegas odds-on favorite is Fredrick Scramm,
  who weighs about 280 pounds, but scored highest on the fitness test, and regularly enjoys walking long distances.
* Walkers can verbally insult and verbally threaten soldiers and spectators,
  but cannot commit any acts of aggression against anyone, or they will receive a penalty-warning.
* Walkers who kill anyone are given their ticket.
* There are 6 walkers from Rhode Island which is the highest number from Rhode Island in the history of The Long Walk&reg;.
  Usually there are no walkers from Rhode Island because of its small size.
* There are also 6 walkers from Texas, which ties the record from seventeen years ago. Usually there are 4 or 5 walkers from Texas due to its size.
* There are no walkers from California, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee.
* There are 17 boys named Peter.
* There are 10 boys with the last name Foster.
* There are 2 boys named Peter Foster.
* There are 2 boys with last name Baker.
* There are 2 boys with last name Wayne.
* About forty spectators die each year from various causes like being trampled by the crowd, run over by the halftrack,
  ricochet from bullet from soldier, bombs set off by protestors, and so on. Know the risks! Stay aware! Stay safe!
