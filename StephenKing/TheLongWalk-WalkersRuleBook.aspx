Prime-Walkers and Backups must arrive between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.
<strong>IMPORTANT: The Long Walk&reg; will begin promptly at 9:00 AM on May 1.</strong>

If you arrive in your own vehicle, proceed through the drive-in gate.

Enclosed is your blue plastic ID card. Upon arrival, hand this card to the guard. You will not receive the card back.
The guard will feed your card into the computer terminal. If it reads OK-OK-OK, you will be allowed to proceed.
The three OKs indicate that you have passed the physical and two mental tests (questionnaire and essay).

If you arrive in your own vehicle, you may want to be accompanied by someone who will drive the vehicle off the property.
If you arrive alone, your vehicle will be towed 2 weeks after The Long Walk&reg; completes.
This will allow the winner enough time to retrieve their vehicle.

<strong>SCHEDULE:</strong>

7:00 AM
      Arrive any time between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM
      All contents of packsacks will be inspected, and walkers will be padded down for illegal items.

8:00 AM
      Prime-Walkers should follow signs to the briefing area near the stone-marker start-post.
      It is recommended that you sit while waiting. Hint 13: Conserve energy whenever possible
      Backups should follow signs to the waiting area and have a seat in the Queue-area.
      Backups will receive a random number representing their spot in the queue.
      This random number is determined by the order that you were picked out of the drum.

8:15 AM
      The Major will arrive to hand out numbers to Prime-Walkers in alphabetical order according to their last name.
      You will be given a large plastic decal number that you must affix to your clothing or skin via pressure strip.
      This must always be in plain sight. See Rule 21 below for where you can attach.
      If any Prime-Walker is not present when their name is called, then a Backup from the queue will fill in for them.
      Backups will be picked from the queue, starting with lowest to highest queue-number.
      If the next Backup in the queue is not present when called, then the next available Backup will take their place.
      If there are not enough Backups, then The Long Walk&reg; will continue with less than 100 walkers.

8:40 AM
      Unused Backups may leave.
      Canteens and foodbelts will be handed out.
      Foodbelts will be wide belts with snap pockets filled with tubes of high-energy concentrate pastes.
      There will also be crackers, peanut-butter and Waifa chocolate bars.
      Canteens will contain distilled water. You can sling the canteen over your shoulder via the strap,
      or clip it to your belt.

8:50 AM
      The Major will ask you to line up in rows of ten near the stone-marker start-post on the road.
      You may start in any order.  Stay with your friends if you like.
      Stand on the provided lines.  Rows are spaced 10 feet apart so everyone can start walking simultaneously.

9:00 AM
      The Major will start the walk.
      Your timers will start counting down immediately, so everyone will lose a few seconds while getting up
      to low speed cut-off of four miles per hour.
      A Backup will be excused from the walk if the Prime-Walker or Backup that they replaced, arrives late.
      Late-arrivals must start from the stone-marker start-post once they check-in, receive their number, foodbelt and canteen.
      Late-arrivals must double-time it at 8+ mph until they catch up with the last walker, then resume 4+ mph.

Your walking speed will be measured by the radar-dishes and sonar-devices on the halftrack which will ride alongside the walk on the shoulder.
Each walker has a timer that is maintained by a digital-computer inside the halftracks and displayed on a monitor atop the halftrack.
Your timer is initialized to two minutes and counts down when your speed drops below four miles per hour.
The loudhailer on the halftrack announces a warning which includes the walkers' number, if a walker's timer reaches one of three thresholds.

Timer Range Warning and Ticket
90.0001-120 No warning
60.0001- 90 First Warning
30.0001- 60 Second Warning
 0.0001- 30 Third Warning
 0.0000     Ticket

<strong>Example using number 13:</strong>
Timer counts down to 90 seconds, they will hear "Warning! Warning 13!"
Timer counts down to 60 seconds, they will hear "Warning! Warning 13! Second warning, 13!"
Timer counts down to 30 seconds, they will hear "Warning! Warning 13! Third warning, 13!"
Timer timer is under 15 seconds, and speed in correct direction is under 4 mph, soldiers carbines will come down from high port and point at walker.
Timer timer is under 15 seconds, and speed in correct direction was under 4 mph but is now 4 mph or higher, carbines will return to high port.
If a walker's timer reaches 0, they are given a ticket. There is no warning.

<strong>For every hour you walk without a warning, you lose a warning.</strong>
If you have 3 warnings, your timer will reset to 60 seconds (2 warnings)
If you have 2 warnings, your timer will reset to 30 seconds (1 warning)
If you have 1 warning,  your timer will reset to  0 seconds (0 warnings)

<strong>Two type of warnings:</strong>
The first type already mentioned is a <strong>courtesy-warning</strong> to let you know that your timer is counting down.
The second type of warning is a <strong>penalty-warning</strong> for breaking a rule.

<strong>Penalty-Warnings:</strong>
A penalty-warning causes your timer to instantly drop to the next warning-threshold or ticket.

If you have 0 warnings, your timer will drop to 90 seconds (1 warning)
If you have 1 warning,  your timer will drop to 60 seconds (2 warnings)
If you have 2 warnings, your timer will drop to 30 seconds (3 warnings)
If you have 3 warnings, your timer will drop to  0 seconds (ticket)

<strong>Examples:</strong>
If your timer is at 120 (0 warnings), it drops to 90 (1 warning)
If your timer is at  91 (0 warnings), it drops to 90 (1 warning)
If your timer is at  90 (1 warning),  it drops to 60 (2 warnings)
If your timer is at  61 (1 warning),  it drops to 60 (2 warnings)
If your timer is at  60 (2 warnings), it drops to 30 (3 warnings)
If your timer is at  31 (2 warnings), it drops to 30 (3 warnings)
If your timer is at  30 (3 warnings), it drops to  0 (ticket)
If your timer is at   1 (3 warnings), it drops to  0 (ticket)

<strong>Examples of rules that will cause a penalty-warning:</strong>
* Accepting assistance from a non-walker (includes food, drink, and medical assistance)
* Attempt to prevent another walker from getting a ticket by obstructing soldiers
* Interfering with another walker
  Interference is defined as physical contact that causes a walkers speed to drop below four miles per hour.
  Interference is judged on a case-by-case basis.
  Tapping someone on the shoulder, causing them to slow under four miles per hour, is not interference.
  Waking someone verbally who is dozing, causing them to slow, stumble or fall, is not interference.
  Tripping, blocking, tackling, flat-tiring, kicking, punching, biting, bumping, ramming, etc., is interference.
* Attacking a walker, even if it does not interfere with their progress.
* Walking in the opposite direction as the correct direction.
  Correct direction is defined as the direction the halftrack is traveling.
  If you drop something like your foodbelt, or your shoe comes off, think twice before going back to pick it up.
  <strong>IMPORTANT: If you have three warnings, walking in the wrong direction is an instant ticket.</strong>
  <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Your timer will also be counting down since your speed is negative.
* Assisting a walker with walking or getting assistance with walking.
  No assistance can be given or taken for walking.
  <em>You can assist a walker to stand or be assisted to stand.</em>
* Assisting a walker with their shoes. You cannot help a walker take a shoe off,
  put a shoe on, tie shoes laces, give them your shoes, help them repair a shoe, etc.
* Carry or drag a walker
* Throwing things at anyone with the intent to harm.
  You can throw things to anyone.
  Your actions will be judged on a case by case basis.
  RECOMMEND: Throwing something gently underhand is considered friendly without intention to harm.
  AVOID: Throwing something overhand with force is considered aggressive with intention to harm.
* Spitting on anyone.
* Urinating on anyone.
* Defecating on anyone.
* Bleeding on purpose on anyone.
* Calling for a canteen for a fellow-walker. Walkers must call for their own canteen.
* Attempting to take items from a walker who bought their ticket for example foodbelt, shoes, clothing, packsack, etc.

<strong>Examples of actions that will NOT yield a penalty-warning:</strong>
* Walking perpendicular to the center-line toward the shoulder
* Stopping
* Sitting
* Verbal insults to anyone
* Obscene gestures to anyone
* Verbally trying to pick a fight with anyone
* Nudity, exposing private parts
* Public urination on the road
* Public bowl movements on the road
* Spitting on the road or vehicles
* Assisting a walker with cramps. You may massage another walker's muscles. You may also help them stretch.
* Slapping, pushing, shoving, poking a walker in a friendly manner as a way to encourage them,
  for example, if their speed has dropped below 4+ mph
* Accepting food and drink from another walker, even if that food and drink was illegally obtained

<strong>Examples of instant-tickets:</strong>
* Timer reaches 0
* Being more than 24 hours late for The Long Walk&reg;
* Killing anyone
* Attacking a non-walker
* Leave the road for any reason, even if by accident. This includes sleep-walking or running in a panic.
  Exception to this rule is if anyone forces you off the road.
  In that case, they will get the ticket, and you must return to the road as soon as possible.
  If you are forced off the road, but do not return once you are able, then you will get a ticket too.
  If you are too tired, injured or sick to return, then you will get a ticket.
  The median and shoulder are considered part of the road, so you may walk on them.
  You are allowed to walk on either side of a median.
  You CANNOT proceed past a spectator wall, restraining rope, tape, strap or guardrail.
  Doing so will result in a ticket.
  You are allowed to walk up to barrier for physical contact with spectators.
* Backing out after the last backout date (April 31). This goes for Prime-Walkers,
  or Backups that were chosen to Backup someone who backed out.
  Exception: If your transportation was delayed for any reason beyond your control,
  or a doctor-of-the-state has deemed you unfit for the walk due to sudden sickness or
  injury (cannot be self-inflicted or be suspicious in any way),
  or a friend or family member has prevented you from attending against your will,
  or the Major has granted you a last-minute exception.
  If your transportation was delayed for reasons beyond your control,
  or soldiers rescued you from a friend or family member
  that prevented you from attending against your will,
  then you will report to the start as usual location, as soon as is possible,
  then check-in, get your number, foodbelt, canteen,
  then be escorted to The Long Walk&reg; in progress.
  <strong>IMPORTANT: ASKING THE MAJOR IF YOU CAN BACKOUT, BUYS YOU A TICKET</strong>

<strong>Rules for soldiers after third warning</strong>

If you have 3 warnings, and your timer is counting down, one or more soldiers will point their rifle at you.
When your timer stops counting down, soldier(s) will raise their rifles to high port.
Once your timer goes below 20 seconds, soldier(s) will place their finger in the trigger.

        If you interfere with another walker while attempting to run away or defend yourself, you will receive a penalty-warning.

<strong>HINTS:</strong>

Hint 1: Have a plan.
Hint 2: Tell yourself "I'm going to win this"
Hint 3: Do not, repeat, do not wear sneakers. Nothing will give you blisters faster than sneakers on The Long Walk&reg;.
Hint 4: Be positive.
Hint 5: Be confident.
Hint 6: Slow and easy does it. Conserve Wind.
Hint 7: If you get tired, you just adjust. Adjustment is key.
Hint 8: It is very important to concentrate on calmness at the beginning, so you can focus.
Hint 9: Have a sense of humor.
Hint 10: Save your wind. If you smoke ordinarily, try not to smoke on The Long Walk&reg;.
Hint 11: Stay hydrated. Avoid drinking alcohol a week before The Long Walk&reg;. It can dehydrate you.
Hint 12: Wear white athletic socks.
Hint 13: Conserve energy whenever possible.
Hint 14: Bring a watch with a timer. When you get a warning,
         start the timer so you know when an hour has passed, and your warning is removed.
Hint 15: Wear a light packsack
Hint 16: Things to bring in your packsack
  - Comfort food (cookies, jelly sandwich, olives, macaroons)
  - Toilet paper
  - Toothbrush
  - Raw hamburger is good fast energy
  - Vinyl rainhat
  - Notebook and pen to take notes for the book you'll write
  - Transistor radio sealed in plastic bag, to get weather report, and other news and music
  - Batteries for transistor radio
  - Fresh shirt
  - Wind-breaker or light-weight jacket that can fold up
  - Dimes to play the trading-dimes game to pass the time
  - Spare clothing or light weight shoes
Hint 17: Wear light-weight high-quality hiking-boots. Avoid the big heavy Oxford boots. If you buy for too much distance, you gain too much weight.
Hint 18: Make sure your clothing fits properly.
Hint 19: Wear a belt. You may lose weight on The Long Walk&reg;, so your pants may start to drop, so wear a belt to keep them in place
Hint 20: Synthetics may cause hives or rashes.
Hint 21: Wear the same shoes and clothing you intend to wear for 24 hours per day for 5 days
         without bathing to make sure there are no problems with blisters or allergic reactions
Hint 22: Do not lead the pack. This is not a race. Leading the pack is not an advantage. You will burn out early if you lead the pack.
Hint 23: Be prepared but don't carry too much. Your packsack should not be too heavy. You will need to wear it for many days.
Hint 24: Consult with your doctor on how to prevent or deal with things like muscle cramps, nosebleeds, fainting, seizures, etc.
Hint 25: Wiggle your toes once every hour to help with circulation.
Hint 26: Transistor radios are allowed. Wrap in plastic bag.
Hint 25: Keep your energy up. When you receive your food belt, snack from it throughout the day.
         Do not eat all the food in one meal.
Hint 26: Research the history of The Long Walk&reg; and research the reasons why most walkers died,
         then try to prevent those reasons from happening to you.
Hint 27: Since contact with spectators is allowed, meet with friends, family and/or trainer, every 3 or 4 hours whenever allowed,
         for a 90 second massage and stretch. Make sure you have no warnings before you start your pit-stop.
Hint 28: Break in your hiking-boots to reduce chance of blisters and increase comfort
Hint 29: Bring a second pair of light-weight shoes in case the first pair fails for any reason or is giving you blisters.
         Sneakers or moccasins are recommended. Tie them firmly so they don't rub, but not too tight, to avoid cutting off circulation.
Hint 30: If your shoes are giving you blisters even when properly tied, remove them. Better to walk in your socks or bare feet.
Hint 31: If one shoe loses a heel, remove both shoes. It takes more energy to walk when you are off balance.
Hint 32: Do not wear cotton socks. They hold moisture close to your skin and accelerate the blister process.
         Pick socks that fit snugly without wrinkles or annoying seams.
         Then find what feels best for you thickness-wise and experiment with wearing a thin,
         sweat-wicking synthetic sock under a thicker wool layer. You can also try blister-resistant socks.
Hint 33: Buy supportive insoles to help keep your foot from sliding around inside your boot.
Hint 34: Focus on the good things in life. Smell that fresh air. Enjoy the sunset and sunrise.
         Listen to the sounds of nature. The wind through the trees, birds-chirping and the crickets.
         Enjoy the beauty of clouds and green trees. Listen to the sound of the stream.
         Observe the beauty in nature. Wave and smile to the crowd and enjoy your fame.
         Enjoy each mouthful of food as you eat. Tell jokes. Laugh.
Hint 35: Pain is a mindset. You can choose to ignore pain. Learn to accept the pain.
Hint 36: Wrap food in tinfoil to keep try.
Hint 37: When dozing, be sure not to walk of the road and get a ticket. Try to follow the center-line.
Hint 38: Avoid the temptation of making-out with pretty-girl spectators. It can lead to deadly cramps.
Hint 39: Find comfort in your religion. Pray. Ask your God for strength and guidance.
         Many walkers find the Hail Mary chant comforting.
Hint 38: If there is a stone in your shoe, stop and remove it quickly.
         Practice removing and putting on your shoes quickly, so you can do it under 30 seconds to avoid warnings.
Hint 39: If there is a fold on your sock, stop, remove your shoe, smooth your sock. A fold in the sock will give you a blister.
Hint 40: Practice walking bare footed on the road just in case it comes to that.
Hint 41: Wear breathable clothing that dries quickly.
Hint 42: Ration your food to last all day, through the night to the next morning. You may need energy if there is a steep hill.
Hint 43: You may share your food with other walkers, but keep in mind, this may make it harder for you to win.
Hint 44: You may aid other walkers, but keep in mind, this may make it harder for you to win.
Hint 45: Making friends may make it difficult later when you have to walk your friend to death.
Hint 46: On the other hand, friends may help you to win.
Hint 47: You may ask for a new water canteen at any time.
         Simply yell using your number: "New canteen for 13! 13 needs new canteen!".
Hint 48: If you feel hot or faint, pour your water canteen over your head.
Hint 49: Practice moving your bowels quickly while squatting with your pants around your ankles.
Hint 50: If you get diarrhea and get 3 warnings from squatting,
         then try dropping your trousers above your knees to release your bowls while maintaining 4+ mph.
Hint 51: Urinate and Defecate off to the side of the road. Nobody wants to walk through your feces and urine.
Hint 52: Try to walk off all warnings before defecating.
Hint 53: Practice urinating while walking 4+ mph. It is easier to walk forward while urinating.
Hint 54: Stop for a 60 to 90 seconds every 4 hours to rest, stretch and massage your muscles.
         See section on stretches and self-muscle massages.
Hint 55: Pair up with a friend to take turns give each other muscle massages every 4 hours,
         for 60 to 90 seconds, once you both have no warnings.
Hint 56: If you have your third warning, keep an eye on the soldiers.
         If they raise their guns in your direction, it means your pace is under 4 mph.
         The soldier(s) will place the index finger on the trigger at 20 seconds.
         The soldier(s) will remove the safety catch at 10 seconds.
Hint 57: Use your watches' stopwatch to track your own time when you get a warning, so you know how close you are to a new warning or a ticket.
Hint 58: Do not try to escape at any time. It does not matter if it's dark, raining, snowing, hailing, etc.,
         the soldiers use infrared sweep-scopes, high-intensity microphones, and other monitoring gear, to easily track all walkers in all situations.
Hint 59: Wear a sweater, light-jacket or wind-breaker, preferably water-proof. The nights can be cold.
Hint 60: Psychological warfare is allowed. See section on Psy War. You are allowed to say anything to anyone.
Hint 61: Psy War: Fake it until you make it. Appear strong. Don't limp. Look confident. Don't admit to being in pain.
         If they say they feel like they can walk to Virginia, say that you feel like you can walk all the way to Florida.
         Others will give up, if they think they cannot win.
         If you are allowed to verbally prod another walker into attacking you, then duck and side-step their attacks,
         they will get penalty warnings which could result in them buying a ticket.
Hint 62: Avoid getting run over by the halftrack. Do not walk in front of the halftrack. Do not try to climb onto the halftrack.
         Always maintain 10 feet distance from the halftrack.
Hint 63: If you are having trouble keeping pace and keep getting warnings, find a walker who is not getting warnings,
         and keep pace with them, preferably a slower walking walker, typically the walker at the back of the pack.
Hint 64: Have a motivation. Know what you want to get out of The Long Walk&reg;
Hint 65: Know what you want your prize to be before you begin The Long Walk&reg;
Hint 66: Make a plan to see friends, girlfriends and family along The Long Walk&reg;. This will give you a psychological boost.
         But be warned, if they don't show up, it can have the opposite effect.
Hint 67: Have your friends and family register (see visitor registration) so they can get reserve seating on the front lines in crowded cities.
         They will receive a pass in the mail. Keep in mind, these sections are near the TV cameras and your reunions will be broadcasted internationally on State TV.
Hint 66: See map of route for sections that allow non-local spectators. Low density areas that are not cordoned off, do not require registration.
Hint 67: Walk parallel to the center line in the correct direction. Angling toward the side of the road will reduce your speed measured parallel to the center line.
Hint 68: If you want to angle-off in a direction that deviates from parallel to the center-line,
         then do so at a small angle so your speed measured to the parallel line does not drop significantly.
Hint 69: Walking at a right-angle to the center-line will be measured at 0 mph.
         The more you deviate from walking parallel to the center-line, the slower your speed is measured.
Hint 70: If you your timer reaches 0, do not try to avoid getting your ticket.
         It could result in a painful death if you try to duck, dodge or run.
         Soldiers are trained to make painless kills.
         If you do not want to suffer, remain still, otherwise you risk
         getting your fellow walkers and spectators shot if you move around.
Hint 71: If walkers are fighting, let them fight. It's to your advantage. Encourage it.
<a name="hint72">Hint 72</a>: Do not eat food, drink liquid, or smoke anything from another walker or spectator. It could be poisoned.
Hint 73: Try to get everyone to agree at the start, not to help each other.
         Convince them that it is in their best interest to end The Long Walk&reg; as soon as possible.
         Helping each other will only extend The Long Walk&reg; and the winner will incur more damage to their body.
