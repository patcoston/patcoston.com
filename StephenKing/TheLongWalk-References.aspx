EDITS MADE CLOSE TO PUBLISH IN 1979

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Now_for_Something_Completely_Different
- 1971 Monty Python's Flying Circus, catchphase "And Now for Something Completely Different"
They wanted to see what screwing a dead man felt like.
Now for Something Completely New and Different.
I don't know if Gribble got much out of it, but they sure as shit did.

Official Detective magazine
from 1934 to 1976 named Official Detective Stories then renamed in 1977 to Official Detective, last issue 1995
http://www.pofoz.com/magazines/true-crime/titles/official-detective-stories/index.html
his next step with that foot left a bloody track, like a photograph in an Official Detective magazine.

John Travolta and Charles Atlas
"Garraty snatched a paper out of the dark and crazy air at random and found himself looking at a Charles Atlas body-building ad. He grabbed another one and was brought face-to-face with John Travolta."
You don't see Charles Atlas ads these days, so it places this time period before the 1980s.  I'm thinking early 1970s at the latest.
John Travolta starred in Carrie in 1976 when he was 22.  He was 13 in 1967.  imdb.com lists his first role was on Emergency! on TV in 1972.
How is it John Travolta was famous enough to get a mention in 1967?  Before 1972, he was in the play Grease! on Broadway in 1972, and later in the movie 1978.
Since "The Long Walk" wasn't published until 1979, my guess is that John Travolta was added in later edits, after he became famous
on TV's Welcome Back, Kotter (1975), Saturday Night Fever (1977), and Grease (1978).
When was there ever a time when there was Charles Atlas ads after John Travolta got famous.
Charles Atlas died 1972.  The ads started in the 1930s.  The comic/magazine ads disappeared late 70s.
Somehow he has a web site: http://www.charlesatlas.com/

Ron Howard
"Ron Howard with a hardon" takes a new meaning today.  Ron Howard would be 64 as of 2018.  When the book was published in 1979, Ron Howard was playing a 16 or 17 year old on the TV show Happy Days, so that's what Stephen King was probably referring to.  It's also evidence that King updated the book before publishing since he wrote the bulk of it from 1966 to 1967.
Ron Howard was 12 or 13 from 1966 to 1967, when Stephen King wrote The Long Walk.
It was a comment obviously targeted at the teenage Ron Howard, who was probably best known for his character Opie in The Andy Griffith Show, which aired from 1960 to 1968.
Many things are still tied to 1967, so I would argue The Long Walk occurs in the an alternate universe in the year 1967, where some tech is futuristic.
Ron Howard starred in the TV show happy days from 1974 to 1984.  He was about 20 years old when it started, but he played a teenager of maybe 16 or 17.

* The name Reggie Cotter (the only boy to finish the long walk from Maine) may inspired by the TV show, Welcome Back Kotter, which was popular at the time of publish.
  The connection is that John Travolta starred in this TV show, and in the movie Carrie (1976) by Stephen King.

- What's it all about, Alphie? It's a reference from a Burt Bacharach song named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKt4IWKy1mU&feature=youtu.be&t=46">Alphie</a>, off the album Reach Out, which was released Jan 1 1967, right when Stephen King was in the middle of writing the book.
- Most young people reading the book won't get this reference, but it would have been hilarious in 1967.
  "What's it all about?"
  Suddenly Garraty cackled madly. "What's it all about, Alfie?"

Foreign Legion
I got into this Long Walk shit the same way that guys used to get into the Foreign Legion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion
https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/10/14/hard-truth-about-foreign-legion/
Nothing much about its culture has changed since the German recruit Erwin Rosen, quoted by Adrian Gilbert in Voices of the Foreign Legion, wrote in the early 1900s:
It is always being drummed into the legionnaire that he is intended for nothing else in this world except for marching. If the pangs of hunger are gnawing at his stomach or thirst parches his tongue, that is so much the worse for him, but it is no reason for his not marching on! He may be tired, dead tired, completely exhausted-but he must not stop marching. If his feet are bleeding and the soles burn like fire, that is very sad-but the marching pace must not be slackened. The sun may burn till his senses are all awhirl, he must go on.
https://aeon.co/essays/why-young-men-queue-up-to-die-in-the-french-foreign-legion
In its first version, the Legion was seen as a rough mercenary force that guaranteed immunity from criminal prosecution, as well as a new life and French citizenship.
Young men still queue to join up in great numbers. Several thousand apply per year, and some 80 per cent are rejected
death is close to the heart of the Legion's attraction.

WE GAVE AWAY THE PANAMA CANAL TO THE COMMUNIST NIGGERS.
https://www.history.com/news/7-fascinating-facts-about-the-panama-canal
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos of Panama signed treaties that transferred control of the canal to Panama in 1999 but gave the United States the right to use military force to defend the waterway against any threat to its neutrality. Despite opposition by a number of politicians who didn't want their country to give up its authority over the canal, the U.S. Senate ratified the Torrijos-Carter Treaties by a narrow margin in 1978. Control of the canal was transferred peacefully to Panama in December 1999, and the Panamanians have been responsible for it ever since.

- The think the meaning of "I should have read her Swinburne when the wind was wrong", is that I should have read her poetry that would have turned her off, when the air smelled like cowshit.
I even took to reading Keats to her out in back of the house, when the wind was right. Her old man kept cows, and the smell of cowshit goes, to put it in the most delicate way, in a peculiar fashion with the works of John Keats. Maybe I should have read her Swinburne when the wind was wrong." McVries laughed.

- He is referencing the story of The Little Mermaid.  He wrote the book 1966/1967, published 1979 but the animated Disney movie came out 1989 and live action 2018.  They removed the part about the knives.
It made him think of a story his mother had read him when he was small. It was about a mermaid who wanted to be a woman. Only she had a tail and a good fairy or someone said she could have legs if she wanted them badly enough.
