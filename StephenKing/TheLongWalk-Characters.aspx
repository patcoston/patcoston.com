<td>(First) Abraham</td>
<td>It was Abraham, 2.
Nickname: Abe
A tall boy with reddish hair in jeans and a T-shirt.
His jacket was tied about his waist schoolboy style and flapped wildly around his knees.
"Why not?" A deep, somber voice said. It was Abraham, 2.
He was tall and disjointed-looking;
he walked in a perpetual shamble.
Abraham's skin was fish-belly white.
Abraham looked more like a convict with his shirt off.
"Fourscore and seven years ago," Abraham intoned, and for an eerie moment it was as if a spirit had inhabited seventeen-year-old Abraham.
I was a Prime Walker, sixteenth out of the drum, as a matter of fact.
It was Abraham, looking like a victim of the Bataan March. For some inconceivable reason he had shucked both his jacket and his shirt, leaving his bony chest and stacked ribcage bare.
"Why'd you take off your shirt?" he asked Abraham suddenly. "It was making my skin itch. It was raising hives or something. It was a synthetic, maybe I have an allergy to synthetic fibers
Religious: "I'll hit you!" Abraham warned. His face was very pale. "I will, Pete!"
"A praaayin' man!" McVries gibed, and he giggled again. "Oh my suds and body! Oh my sainted hat!"
"I get Marilyn Monroe," McVries said. "You can have Eleanor Roosevelt, Abe old buddy."
Abraham and Collie Parker were lackadaisically discussing the merits of four-barrel carbs.

"I'm Art Baker," the other said quietly.
Baker ambled along, moving in a kind of knee-bent shuffle that seemed to cover the ground when you weren't looking.
He swung his coat idly, smiled at the pointing people, and sometimes whistled a low snatch of some tune or other.
Garraty thought he looked like he could go on forever.
In the fading daylight, Baker's face was soft and young and beautiful.
Baker was up ahead&mdash;he could tell it was him by the flapping red-striped shirt
He spoke with a very slight Southern accent.
Pearson and Baker were talking about chess
Con Artist: "And I usually don't match dimes with guys that call me that,"
Baker had his vial of olives&mdash;real olives&mdash;and was popping them into his mouth with machine-gun regularity.
Baker said, slinging his light jacket over his arm.
the boy to his right was much chubbier than Art Baker. (implying that Art Baker was a little chubby)
The Woman in White, by Wilkie Collins ... that's my favorite book
Poor: "You might be if you grew up on potato soup and collards," Baker sid. "Sidemeat only when your daddy could afford the ammunition."
I had a brother that was in law trouble
Baker was wearing his jacket, and it was soaked.
Ask your cracker friend, Art Baker.

Nickname: Killer
I'm Gary Barkovitch, by the way. My home is Washington, D.C.
It was a small dark, intense-looking boy with the number 5 pressed to the collar of his jacket.
Dark, intense, his olive-sallow face shiny with sweat
He stared at Garraty with his hooded dark brown eyes
There were three of them in a fatigue-ridden conga line: Barkovitch at the front
You have to pace yourself. You have to focus on yourself. You have to have a Plan.
"Spoils the Walkers' concentration," a sharp voice said.
Short: Garraty looked down at Gary Barkovitch.
The guns were centered on a small, nearly portly figure. It looked like Barkovitch.
Barkovitch had put on a yellow vinyl rainhat
He pressed his thumb reflectively against the end of his rather sharp nose. There was a bright red pimple there.
Barkovitch looked slowly around at Garraty with his bright black shoebutton eyes.
Yes, he looked remarkably like some destructive child's teddy bear this morning.
Racist: Barkovitch joined them. Barkovitch was looking at Ewing, too.
"Blisters!" He made it sound like Ewing's mother was a whore. "What the hell can you expect from a dumb nigger? Now I ask you."
"That guy drives me up the wall," Pearson said. "He'd be glad to hear it," McVries said. "He likes it.

<td>Davidson, 8, dropped back with them.
He was a good-looking boy except for the rash of acne on his forehead.
<em>Assuming he is from Ohio because he would go to the Steubenville State Fair, which is in Ohio</em>
A few minutes later Davidson joined the group and told them about the times he got drunk at the Steubenville State Fair and
crawled into the hoochie-kooch tent and got biffed in the head by a big fat momma wearing nothing but a G-string.
He had had a packsack the last time Garraty saw him, but he noticed that at some point Davidson had cast it away.

A bright seepage of blood ran through his fingers, shining in the sunlight. Old Percy What's-Your-Name.
