<h1>Stephen King: Sorted</h1>

<pre>
I bought all Stephen King novels, novellas and collections of short-stories as eBooks,
then converted them to text files.  I removed all but the story from each,
then combined them into a single text file.  I then split each sentence onto its own line,
then sorted it alphabetically.  You can see the full list <a href="StephenKing-Sorted.txt">here</a>.
</pre>

<p>Below are some of the highlights:</p>

A moment later Dorgan was on.
A moment later Dr. Handor was feeling Eddie's broken arm.
