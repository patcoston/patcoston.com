            the idea of fainting about two o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
            Now there was a genuinely unpleasant thought. You wouldn&rsquo;t know anything, probably. Wouldn&rsquo;t
            feel anything. You&rsquo;d just wake up in eternity.</li>

                <p>&ldquo;Ray.&rdquo; McVries was still smiling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo;<br />Yeah, that
                    was right. Hint 6: Slow and easy does it. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;<br />McVries went on smiling.
                    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me too much. I&rsquo;m out to win, too.&rdquo;<br />Garraty stared at him,
                    disconcerted.<br />&ldquo;I mean, let&rsquo;s not put this on a Three Musketeers basis. I like you
                    and it&rsquo;s obvious you&rsquo;re a big hit with the pretty girls. But if you fall over I
                    won&rsquo;t pick you up.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He smiled back, but his smile felt lame.</p>

            <div style="display:none">
                <p>&ldquo;Our first boneyard,&rdquo; McVries said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on your side. Ray, you lose all
                    your points. Remember that game?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You talk too goddam much,&rdquo; Olson said
                    suddenly.<br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with graveyards, Henry, old buddy? A fine and private
                    place, as the poet said. A nice watertight casket&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Just shut up!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh,
                    pickles,&rdquo; McVries said. His scar flashed very white in the dying daylight. &ldquo;You
                    don&rsquo;t really mind the thought of dying, do you, Olson? Like the poet also said, it
                    ain&rsquo;t the dying, it&rsquo;s laying in the grave so long. Is that what&rsquo;s bugging you,
                    booby?&rdquo; McVries began to trumpet. &ldquo;Well, cheer up, Charlie! There&rsquo;s a brighter
                    day com&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; Baker said quietly.<br />&ldquo;Why
                    should I? He&rsquo;s busy convincing himself he can crap out any time he feels like it. That if he
                    just lays down and dies, it won&rsquo;t be as bad as everyone makes out. Well, I&rsquo;m not going
                    to let him get away with it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t die, you will,&rdquo; Garraty
                    said.<br />&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m remembering,&rdquo; McVries said, and gave Garraty his tight,
                    slanted smile ... only this time there was absolutely no humor in it at all. Suddenly McVries
                    looked furious, and Garraty was almost afraid of him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s
                    forgetting. This turkey here.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do it anymore,&rdquo; Olson
                    said hollowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Raring to rip,&rdquo; McVries said,
                    turning on him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you said? Fuck it, then. Why don&rsquo;t you just fall
                    down and die then?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; Garraty said.<br />&ldquo;Listen,
                    Ray&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No, you listen. One Barkovitch is enough. Let him do it his own way.
                    No musketeers, remember.&rdquo;<br />McVries smiled again. &ldquo;Okay, Garraty. You win.&rdquo;<br />Olson
                    didn&rsquo;t say anything. He just kept picking them up and laying them down.</p>

                    McVries said between pants. &ldquo;Pick up your feet. I want to see you dance up this hill like
                    Fred Astaire.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What do you care?&rdquo; Olson asked fiercely.<br />McVries
                    didn&rsquo;t answer. Olson found a little more inside himself and managed to pick it up. Garraty
                    wondered morbidly if the little more Olson had found was his last legs.</p>

            <div style="display:none">
                <p>Oh boy&mdash;<br />Garraty was suddenly aware that he felt quite giddy, as if he might faint
                    himself. He brought one hand up and slapped himself across the face, backward and forward, hard.<br />&ldquo;You
                    all right?&rdquo; McVries asked.<br />&ldquo;Feel faint.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Pour your ...&rdquo;
                    Quick, whistling breath, &ldquo;... canteen over your head.&rdquo;<br />Garraty did it. I christen
                    thee Raymond Davis Garraty, pax vobiscum. The water was very cold. He stopped feeling faint. Some
                    of the water trickled down inside his shirt in freezing cold rivulets. &ldquo;Canteen! 47!&rdquo;
                    he shouted. The effort of the shout left him feeling drained all over again. He wished he had
                    waited awhile.<br />One of the soldiers jog-trotted over to him and handed him a fresh canteen.
                    Garraty could feel the soldier&rsquo;s expressionless marble eyes sizing him up. &ldquo;Get
                    away,&rdquo; he said rudely, taking the canteen. &ldquo;You get paid to shoot me, not to look at
                    me.&rdquo;<br />The soldier went away with no change of expression. Garraty made himself walk a
                    little faster.</p>

                <p>
                    <div>McVries suddenly ran at the halftrack. Two of the three soldiers raised their guns to high
                        port,
                        ready, but McVries halted, halted dead, and raised his fists at them, shaking them above his
                        head
                        like a mad conductor.</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Come on down here! Put down those rifles and come on down here! I&rsquo;ll show you
                        what&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Warning,&rdquo; one of them said in a perfectly neutral voice. &ldquo;Warning 61.
                        Second
                        warning.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>Oh my God, Garraty thought numbly. He&rsquo;s going to get it and he&rsquo;s so close ... so
                        close
                        to them ... he&rsquo;ll fly through the air just like Freaky D&rsquo;Allessio.</div>
                    <div>McVries broke into a run, caught up with the halftrack, stopped, and spat on the side of it.
                        The
                        spittle cut a clean streak through the dust on the side of the halftrack.</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; McVries screamed. &ldquo;Come on down here! One at a time or all at
                        once, I
                        don&rsquo;t give a shit!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Warning! Third Warning, 61, final warning.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Fuck your warnings!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>Suddenly, unaware he was going to do it, Garraty turned and ran back, drawing his own warning.
                        He
                        only heard it with some back part of his mind. The soldiers were drawing down on McVries now.
                        Garraty grabbed McVries&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Get out of here, Ray, I&rsquo;m gonna fight them!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>Garraty put out his hands and gave McVries a hard, flat shove. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to
                        get
                        shot, you asshole.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div>Stebbins passed them by.</div>
                    <div>McVries looked at Garraty, seeming to recognize him for the first time. A second later Garraty
                        drew his own third warning, and he knew McVries could only be seconds away from his ticket.</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; McVries said in a dead, washed-out voice. He began to walk again.</div>
                    <div>Garraty walked with him. &ldquo;I thought you were going to buy it, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
                        he
                        said.</div>
                    <div>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t, thanks to the musketeer,&rdquo; McVries said sullenly. His hand
                        went to
                        the scar. &ldquo;Fuck, we&rsquo;re all going to buy it.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>You&rsquo;re going to have hysterics, oh my God, don&rsquo;t let it get you, think about Gribble ...
                    and don&rsquo;t ... don&rsquo;t let ... don&rsquo;t ...<br />But it was happening. The laughter
                    came roaring out of him until his stomach was knotted and cramped and he was walking bent-legged
                    and somebody was hollering at him, screaming at him over the roar of the crowd. It was McVries.
                    &ldquo;Ray! Ray! What is it? You all right?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re funny!&rdquo; He was
                    nearly weeping with laughter now. &ldquo;Pete, Pete, they&rsquo;re so funny, it&rsquo;s just ...
                    just ... that they&rsquo;re so funny!&rdquo;<br />A hard-faced little girl in a dirty sundress sat
                    on the ground, pouty-mouthed and frowning. She made a horrible face as they passed. Garraty nearly
                    collapsed with laughter and drew a warning. It was strange&mdash;in spite of all the noise he could
                    still hear the warnings clearly.<br />I could die, he thought. I could just die laughing,
                    wouldn&rsquo;t that be a scream?<br />Collie was still smiling gaily and waving and cursing
                    spectators and newsmen roundly, and that seemed funniest of all. Garraty fell to his knees and was
                    warned again. He continued to laugh in short, barking spurts, which were all his laboring lungs
                    would allow.<br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gonna puke!&rdquo; someone cried in an ecstasy of delight.
                    &ldquo;Watch &rsquo;im, Alice, he&rsquo;s gonna puke!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Garraty! Garraty for
                    God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; McVries was yelling. He got an arm around Garraty&rsquo;s back and hooked
                    a hand into his armpit. Somehow he yanked him to his feet and Garraty stumbled on.<br />&ldquo;Oh
                    God,&rdquo; Garraty gasped. &ldquo;Oh Jesus Christ they&rsquo;re killing me. I ... I can&rsquo;t
                    ...&rdquo; He broke into loose, trickling laughter once more. His knees buckled. McVries ripped him
                    to his feet once more. Garraty&rsquo;s collar tore. They were both warned. That&rsquo;s my last
                    warning, Garraty thought dimly. I&rsquo;m on my way to see that fabled farm. Sorry, Jan, I ...<br />&ldquo;Come
                    on, you turkey, I can&rsquo;t lug you!&rdquo; McVries hissed.<br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
                    it,&rdquo; Garraty gasped. &ldquo;My wind&rsquo;s gone, I&mdash;&rdquo;<br />McVries slapped him
                    twice quickly, forehand on the right cheek, backhand on the left. Then he walked away quickly, not
                    looking back.<br />The laughter had gone out of him now but his gut was jelly, his lungs empty and
                    seemingly unable to refill. He staggered drunkenly along, weaving, trying to find his wind. Black
                    spots danced in front of his eyes, and a part of him understood how close to fainting he was. His
                    one foot fetched against his other foot, he stumbled, almost fell, and somehow kept his balance.<br />If
                    I fall, I die. I&rsquo;ll never get up.<br />They were watching him. The crowd was watching him.
                    The cheers had died away to a muted, almost sexual murmur. They were waiting for him to fall down.<br />He
                    walked on, now concentrating only on putting one foot out in front of the other. Once, in the
                    eighth grade, he had read a story by a man named Ray Bradbury, and this story was about the crowds
                    that gather at the scenes of fatal accidents, about how these crowds always have the same faces,
                    and about how they seem to know whether the wounded will live or die. I&rsquo;m going to live a
                    little longer, Garraty told them. I&rsquo;m going to live. I&rsquo;m going to live a little longer.<br />He
                    made his feet rise and fall to the steady cadence in his head. He blotted everything else out, even
                    Jan. He was not aware of the head, or of Collie Parker, or of Freaky D&rsquo;Allessio. He was not
                    even aware of the steady dull pain in his feet and the frozen stiffness of the hamstring muscles
                    behind his knees. The thought pounded in his mind like a big kettledrum. Like a heartbeat. Live a
                    little longer. Live a little longer. Live a little longer. Until the words themselves became
                    meaningless and signified nothing.<br />It was the sound of the guns that brought him out of it.<br />In
                    the crowd-hushed stillness the sound was shockingly loud and he could hear someone screaming. Now
                    you know, he thought, you live long enough to hear the sound of the guns, long enough to hear
                    yourself screaming&mdash;<br />But one of his feet kicked a small stone then and there was pain and
                    it wasn&rsquo;t him that had bought it, it was 64, a pleasant, smiling boy named Frank Morgan. They
                    were dragging Frank Morgan off the road. His glasses were dragging and bouncing on the pavement,
                    still hooked stubbornly over one ear. The left lens had been shattered.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
                    dead,&rdquo; he said dazedly. Shock hit him in a warm blue wave, threatening to turn his legs to
                    water again.<br />&ldquo;Yeah, but you ought to be,&rdquo; McVries said.<br />&ldquo;You saved
                    him,&rdquo; Olson said, turning it into a curse.&ldquo;Why did you do that? Why did you do
                    that?&rdquo;</p>

                    <div>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Garraty babbled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna be Mr. and Mrs. Norman Normal,

                <p>
                    <div class="tx">Garraty began to cry. He ran over to Olson and fell on his knees beside him and
                        held the tired, hectically hot face against his chest. He sobbed into the dry, bad-smelling
                        hair.</div>
                    <div class="tx">&ldquo;Warning! Warning 47!&rdquo;</div>

                    <div class="tx">McVries was pulling at him. It was McVries again. &ldquo;Get up, Ray, get up, you
                        can&rsquo;t help him, for God&rsquo;s sake get up!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="tx">&ldquo;Its not <em>fair</em>!&rdquo; Garraty wept. There was a sticky smear of
                        Olson&rsquo;s blood on his cheekbone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not fair!&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="tx">&ldquo;I know. Come on. Come on.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="tx">Garraty stood up. He and McVries began walking backward rapidly, watching Olson,
                        who was on his knees. Olson got to his feet. He stood astride the white line. He raised both
                        hands up into the sky. The crowd sighed softly.</div>
                    <div class="tx">&ldquo;I DID IT <em>WRONG</em>!&rdquo; Olson shouted tremblingly, and then fell
                        flat and dead.</div>

                <p>&ldquo;My leg, my leg, my leg!&rdquo; he screamed, unable to help himself.<br />&ldquo;Oh, Jesus,
                    Garraty,&rdquo; Baker had time to say&mdash;nothing in his voice but mild surprise, and then they
                    had passed beyond him, it seemed that they were all passing him as he stood here with his left leg
                    turned to clenched and agonizing marble, passing him, leaving him behind.<br />&ldquo;Warning!
                    Warning 47!&rdquo;<br />Don&rsquo;t panic. If you panic now you&rsquo;ve had the course.<br />He
                    sat down on the pavement, his left leg stuck out woodenly in front of him. He began to massage the
                    big muscles. He tried to knead them. It was like trying to knead ivory.<br />&ldquo;Garraty?&rdquo;
                    It was McVries. He sounded scared ... surely that was only an illusion? &ldquo;What is it? Charley
                    horse?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, I guess so. Keep going. It&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Warning! Warning 47! Third warning, 47!&rdquo; The muscle was not loosening at all. He was
                    going to die. After all this, after ripping his guts out, that was the fact, after all. He let go
                    of his leg and stared calmly at the soldier. He wondered who was going to win. He wondered if
                    McVries would outlast Barkovitch. He wondered what a bullet in the head felt like, if it would just
                    be sudden darkness or if he would actually feel his thoughts being ripped apart. The last few
                    seconds began to drain away. The cramp loosened. Blood flowed back into the muscle, making it
                    tingle with needles and pins, making it warm. The blond soldier with the remotely handsome face put
                    away the pocket chronometer. His lips moved soundlessly as he counted down the last few seconds.
                    But I can&rsquo;t get up, Garraty thought. It&rsquo;s too good just to sit. Just sit and let the
                    phone ring, the hell with it, why didn&rsquo;t I take the phone off the hook? Garraty let his head
                    fall back. The soldier seemed to be looking down at him, as if from the mouth of a tunnel or over
                    the lip of a deep well. In slow motion he transferred the gun to both hands and his right
                    forefinger kissed over the trigger, then curled around it and the barrel started to come around.
                    The soldier&rsquo;s left hand was solid on the stock. A wedding band caught a glimmer of sun.
                    Everything was slow. So slow. Just&nbsp;... hold the phone. This, Garraty thought. This is what
                    it&rsquo;s like. To die. The soldier&rsquo;s right thumb was rotating the safety catch to the off
                    position with exquisite slowness. Three scrawny women were directly behind him, three weird
                    sisters, hold the phone. Just hold the phone a minute longer, I&rsquo;ve got something to die here.
                    Sunshine, shadow, blue sky. Clouds rushing up the highway. Stebbins was just a back now, just a
                    blue workshirt with a sweatstain running up between the shoulder blades, goodbye, Stebbins. Sounds
                    thundered in on him. He had no idea if it was his imagination, or heightened sensibility, or simply
                    the fact of death reaching out for him. The safety catch snapped off with a sound like a breaking
                    branch. The rush of indrawn air between his teeth was the sound of a wind tunnel. His heartbeat was
                    a drum. And there was a high singing, not in his ears but between them, spiraling up and up, and he
                    was crazily sure that it was the actual sound of brainwaves&mdash; He scrambled to his feet in a
                    convulsive flying jerk, screaming. He threw himself into an accelerating, gliding run. His feet
                    were made of feathers. The finger of the soldier tightened on the trigger and whitened. He glanced
                    down at the solid-state computer on his waist, a gadget that included a tiny but sophisticated
                    sonar device. Garraty had once read an article about them in Popular Mechanix. They could read out
                    a single Walker&rsquo;s speed as exactly as you would have wanted, to four numbers to the right of
                    the decimal point. The soldier&rsquo;s finger loosened.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already got three strikes against me. That means you&rsquo;re out, doesn&rsquo;t
                    it?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Call the last one a foul tip,&rdquo; Stebbins said.</p>

                <p>He caught up with McVries, who glanced around. &ldquo;I thought you were out of it, kiddo,&rdquo;
                    McVries said.<br />&ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;That close?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;About two
                    seconds, I think.&rdquo;<br />McVries pursed a silent whistle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
                    like to be in your shoes right now. How&rsquo;s the leg?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Better. Listen, I
                    can&rsquo;t talk. I&rsquo;m going up front for a while.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t help
                    Harkness any.&rdquo;<br />Garraty shook his head. &ldquo;I have to make sure I&rsquo;m topping the
                    speed.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;All right. You want company?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got the
                    energy.&rdquo;<br />McVries laughed. &ldquo;I got the time if you got the money, honey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Come
                    on, then. Let&rsquo;s pick it up while I&rsquo;ve still got the sack for it.&rdquo;<br />Garraty
                    stepped up his pace until his legs were at the point of rebellion, and he and McVries moved quickly
                    through the front-runners. There was a space between the boy who had been walking second, a
                    gangling, evil-faced boy named Harold Quince, and the survivor of the two leather boys. Joe. Closer
                    to, his complexion was startlingly bronzed. His eyes stared steadily at the horizon, and his
                    features were expressionless. The many zippers on his jacket jingled, like the sound of faraway
                    music.<br />&ldquo;Hello, Joe,&rdquo; McVries said, and Garraty had an hysterical urge to add,
                    whaddaya know?<br />&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; Joe said curtly.<br />They passed him and then the road
                    was theirs, a wide double-barreled strip of composition concrete stained with oil and broken by the
                    grassy median strip, bordered on both sides by a steady wall of people.<br />&ldquo;Onward, ever
                    onward,&rdquo; McVries said. &ldquo;Christian soldiers, marching as to war. Ever hear that one,
                    Ray?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;<br />McVries glanced at his watch. &ldquo;2:20,
                    Look, Ray, if you&rsquo;re going to&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;God, is that all? I
                    thought&mdash;&rdquo; He felt panic rising in his throat, greasy and thick. He wasn&rsquo;t going
                    to be able to do it. The margin was just too tight.<br />&ldquo;Look, if you keep thinking about
                    the time, you&rsquo;re gonna go nuts and try to run into the crowd and they&rsquo;ll shoot you
                    dog-dead. They&rsquo;ll shoot you with your tongue hanging out and spit running down your chin. Try
                    to forget about it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Everything was bottling up inside him,
                    making him feel jerky and hot and sick. &ldquo;Olson ... Scramm ... they died. Davidson died. I can
                    die too, Pete! I believe it now. It&rsquo;s breathing down my fucking back!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Think
                    about your girl. Jan, what&rsquo;s-her-face. Or your mother. Or your goddam kitty-cat. Or
                    don&rsquo;t think about anything. Just pick &rsquo;em up and put &rsquo;em down. Just keep on
                    walking down the road. Concentrate on that.&rdquo;<br />Garraty fought for control of himself.
                    Maybe he even got a little. But he was unraveling just the same. His legs didn&rsquo;t want to
                    respond smoothly to his mind&rsquo;s commands anymore, they seemed as old and as flickery as
                    ancient lightbulbs.<br />&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t last much longer,&rdquo; a woman in the front row
                    said quite audibly.<br />&ldquo;Your tits won&rsquo;t last much longer!&rdquo; Garraty snapped at
                    her, and the crowd cheered him.<br />&ldquo; They&rsquo;re screwed up,&rdquo; Garraty muttered.
                    &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really screwed up. Perverted. What time is it, McVries?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What
                    was the first thing you did when you got your letter of confirmation?&rdquo; McVries asked softly.
                    &ldquo;What did you do when you knew you were really in?&rdquo;<br />Garraty frowned, wiped his
                    forearm quickly across his forehead, and then let his mind free of the sweaty, terrifying present
                    to that sudden, flashing moment.<br />&ldquo;I was by myself. My mother works. It was a Friday
                    afternoon. The letter was in the mailbox and it had a Wilmington, Delaware, postmark, so I knew
                    that had to be it. But I was sure it said I&rsquo;d flunked the physical or the mental or both. I
                    had to read it twice. I didn&rsquo;t go into any fits of joy, but I was pleased. Real pleased. And
                    confident. My feet didn&rsquo;t hurt then and my back didn&rsquo;t feel like somebody had shoved a
                    rake with a busted handle into it. I was one in a million. I wasn&rsquo;t bright enough to realize
                    the circus fat lady is, too.&rdquo;<br />He broke off for a moment, thinking, smelling early April.<br />&ldquo;I
                    couldn&rsquo;t back down. There were too many people watching. I think it must work the same with
                    just about everyone. It&rsquo;s one of the ways they tip the game, you know. I let the April 15th
                    backout date go by and the day after that they had a big testimonial dinner for me at the town
                    hall&mdash;all my friends were there and after dessert everyone started yelling Speech! Speech! And
                    I got out and mumbled something down at my hands about how I was gonna do the best I could if I got
                    in, and everyone applauded like mad. It was like I&rsquo;d laid the fucking Gettysburg Address on
                    their heads. You know what I mean?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; McVries said, and
                    laughed&mdash;but his eyes were dark.<br />Behind them the guns thunderclapped suddenly. Garraty
                    jumped convulsively and nearly froze in his tracks. Somehow he kept walking. Blind instinct this
                    time, he thought. What about next time?<br />&ldquo;Son of a bitch,&rdquo; McVries said softly.
                    &ldquo;It was Joe.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Garraty asked, and before McVries
                    could answer he remembered that he was wearing a watch of his own. It was 2:38. Christ. His
                    two-second margin was like an iron dumbbell on his back.<br />&ldquo;No one tried to talk you out
                    of it?&rdquo; McVries asked. They were far out beyond the rest now, better than a hundred yards
                    beyond Harold Quince. A soldier had been dispatched to keep tabs on them. Garraty was very glad it
                    wasn&rsquo;t the blond guy. &ldquo;No one tried to talk you into using the April 31st
                    blackout?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Not at first. My mother and Jan and Dr. Patterson&mdash;he&rsquo;s my
                    mother &rsquo;s special friend, you know, they&rsquo;ve been keeping company for the last five
                    years or so&mdash;they just kind of soft-pedaled it at first. They were pleased and proud because
                    most of the kids in the country over twelve take the tests but only one in fifty passes. And that
                    still leaves thousands of kids and they can use two hundred&mdash;one hundred Walkers and a hundred
                    backups. And there&rsquo;s no skill in getting picked, you know that.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Sure, they
                    draw the names out of that cock-sucking drum. Big TV spectacular.&rdquo; McVries&rsquo;s voice
                    cracked a little.<br />&ldquo;Yeah. The Major draws the two hundred names, but the names&rsquo;re
                    all they announce. You don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a Walker or just a backup.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And
                    no notification of which you are until the final backout date itself,&rdquo; McVries agreed,
                    speaking of it as if the final backout date had been years ago instead of only four days.
                    &ldquo;Yeah, they like to stack the deck their way.&rdquo;<br />Somebody in the crowd had just
                    released a flotilla of balloons. They floated up to the sky in a dissolving arc of reds, blues,
                    greens, yellows. The steady south wind carried them away with taunting, easy speed.<br />&ldquo;I
                    guess so,&rdquo; Garraty said. &ldquo;We were watching the TV when the Major drew the names, I was
                    number seventy-three out of the drum. I fell right out of my chair. I just couldn&rsquo;t believe
                    it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be you,&rdquo; McVries agreed. &ldquo;Things like that
                    always happen to the other guy.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the feeling. That&rsquo;s
                    when everybody started in on me. It wasn&rsquo;t like the first backout date when it was all
                    speeches and pie in the sky by-and-by. Jan ...&rdquo;<br />He broke off. Why not? He&rsquo;d told
                    everything else. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Either he or McVries was going to be dead before it was
                    over. Probably both of them. &ldquo;Jan said she&rsquo;d go all the way with me, any time, any way,
                    as often as I wanted if I&rsquo;d take the April 31st backout. I told her that would make me feel
                    like an opportunist and a heel, and she got mad at me and said it was better than feeling dead, and
                    then she cried a lot. And begged me.&rdquo; Garraty looked up at McVries. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
                    know. Anything else she could have asked me, I would have tried to do it. But this one thing ... I
                    couldn&rsquo;t. It was like there was a stone caught in my throat. After a while she knew I
                    couldn&rsquo;t say Yes, okay, I&rsquo;ll call the 800 number. I think she started to understand.
                    Maybe as well as I did myself, which God knows wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;isn&rsquo;t&mdash;very well.<br />&ldquo;Then
                    Dr. Patterson started in. He&rsquo;s a diagnostician, and he&rsquo;s got a wicked logical mind. He
                    said, &lsquo;Look here, Ray. Figuring in the Prime group and the backups, your chance of survival
                    is fifty-to-one. Don&rsquo;t do this to your mother, Ray.&rsquo; I was polite with him for as long
                    as I could, but finally I told him to just kiss off. I said I figured the odds on him ever marrying
                    my mother were pretty long, but I never noticed him backing off because of that.&rdquo;<br />Garraty
                    ran both hands through the straw-thatch of his hair. He had forgotten about the two-second margin.<br />&ldquo;God,
                    didn&rsquo;t he get mad. He ranted and raved and told me if I wanted to break my mother &rsquo;s
                    heart to just go ahead. He said I was as insensitive as a ... a wood tick, I think that&rsquo;s
                    what he said, insensitive as a wood tick, maybe it&rsquo;s a family saying of his or something, I
                    don&rsquo;t know. He asked me how it felt to be doing the number on my mom and on a nice girl like
                    Janice. So I countered with my own unarguable logic.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Did you,&rdquo; McVries
                    said, smiling. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I told him if he didn&rsquo;t get out I was
                    going to hit him.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What about your mother?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t
                    say much at all. I don&rsquo;t think she could believe it. And the thought of what I&rsquo;d get if
                    I won. The Prize&mdash;everything you want for the rest of your life&mdash;that sort of blinded
                    her, I think. I had a brother, Jeff. He died of pneumonia when he was six, and&mdash;it&rsquo;s
                    cruel&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve gotten along if he&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve
                    lived. And ... I guess she just kept thinking I&rsquo;d be able to back out of it if I did turn out
                    to be Prime. The Major is a nice man. That&rsquo;s what she said. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d let you
                    out of it if he understood the circumstances. But they Squad them just as fast for trying to back
                    out of a Long Walk as they do for talking against it. And then I got the call and I knew I was a
                    Walker. I was Prime.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No.
                    Twelve of the original Walkers used the April 31st backout. I was number twelve, backup. I got the
                    call just past 11 PM four days ago.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Jesus! Is that so?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Uh-huh.
                    That close.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you ... bitter?&rdquo;<br />McVries only
                    shrugged.<br />Garraty looked at his watch. It was 3:02. It was going to be all right. His shadow,
                    lengthening in the afternoon sun, seemed to move a little more confidently. It was a pleasant,
                    brisk spring day. His leg felt okay now.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said.<br />&ldquo;For saving your life again?&rdquo; McVries laughed
                    merrily.<br />&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just right.&rdquo;</p>

                    He saw her. She was waving the blue silk scarf he had gotten her for her
                    birthday, and the rain shimmered in her hair like gems. His mother was beside her, wearing her
                    plain black coat. They had been jammed together by the mob and were being swayed helplessly back
                    and forth. Over Jan&rsquo;s shoulder a TV camera poked its idiot snout.<br />A great sore somewhere
                    in his body seemed to burst. The infection ran out of him in a green flood. He burst into a
                    shambling, pigeon-toed run. His ripped socks flapped and slapped his swollen feet.<br />&ldquo;Jan!
                    Jan!&rdquo;<br />He could hear the thought but not the words in his mouth. The TV camera tracked
                    him enthusiastically. The din was tremendous. He could see her lips form his name, and he had to
                    reach her, had to&mdash;<br />An arm brought him up short. It was McVries. A soldier speaking
                    through a sexless bullhorn was giving them both first warning.<br />&ldquo;Not into the
                    crowd!&rdquo; McVries&rsquo;s lips were against Garraty&rsquo;s ear and he was shouting. A lancet
                    of pain pierced into Garraty&rsquo;s head.<br />&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
                    let you kill yourself, Ray!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Let me go goddammit!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Do you want
                    to die in her arms? Is that it?&rdquo;<br />The time was fleeting. She was crying. He could see the
                    tears on her cheeks. He wrenched free of McVries. He started for her again. He felt hard, angry
                    sobs coming up from inside him. He wanted sleep. He would find it in her arms. He loved her.<br />Ray,
                    I love you.<br />He could see the words on her lips.<br />McVries was still beside him. The TV
                    camera glared down. Now, peripherally, he could see his high school class, and they were unfurling
                    a huge banner and somehow it was his own face, his yearbook photo, blown up to Godzilla size, he
                    was grinning down at himself as he cried and struggled to reach her.<br />Second warning, blared
                    from the loudhailer like the voice of God.<br />Jan&mdash;<br />She was reaching out to him. Hands
                    touching. Her cool hand. Her tears&mdash;<br />His mother. Her hands, reaching&mdash;<br />He
                    grasped them. In one hand he held Jan&rsquo;s hand, in the other his mother &rsquo;s hand. He
                    touched them. It was done.<br />It was done until McVries&rsquo;s arm came down around his shoulder
                    again, cruel McVries.<br />&ldquo;Let me go! Let me go!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Man, you must really
                    hate her!&rdquo; McVries screamed in his ear. &ldquo;What do you want? To die knowing they&rsquo;re
                    both stinking with your blood? Is that what you want? For Christ&rsquo;s sake, come on!&rdquo;<br />He
                    struggled, but McVries was strong. Maybe McVries was even right. He looked at Jan and now her eyes
                    were wide with alarm. His mother made shooing gestures. And on Jan&rsquo;s lips he could read the
                    words like a damnation: Go on! Go on!<br />Of course I must go on, he thought dully. I am
                    Maine&rsquo;s Own. And in that second he hated her, although if he had done anything, it was no
                    more than to catch her&mdash;and his mother&mdash;in the snare he had laid for himself.<br />Third
                    warning for him and McVries, rolling majestically like thunder; the crowd hushed a little and
                    looked on with wet-eyed eagerness. Now there was panic written on the faces of Jan and his mother.
                    His mother &rsquo;s hands flew to her face, and he thought of Barkovitch&rsquo;s hands flying up to
                    his neck and startled doves and ripping out his own throat.<br />&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got to do
                    it, do it around the next corner, you cheap shit!&rdquo; McVries cried.<br />He began to whimper.
                    McVries had beaten him again. McVries was very strong. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, not
                    knowing if McVries could hear him or not. He began to walk. &ldquo;All right, all right, let me
                    loose before you break my collarbone.&rdquo; He sobbed, hiccuped, wiped his nose.<br />McVries let
                    go of him warily, ready to grab him again.<br />Almost as an afterthought, Garraty turned and
                    looked back, but they were already lost in the crowd again. He thought he would never forget that
                    look of panic rising in their eyes, that feeling of trust and sureness finally kicked brutally
                    away. He got nothing but half a glimpse of a waving blue scarf.<br />He turned around and faced
                    forward again, not looking at McVries, and his stumbling, traitorous feet carried him on and they
                    walked out of town.</p>

                    He wondered how long it had been since he was hungry, and he wondered how long it would be before
                    he fainted if he didn&rsquo;t eat something. He thought that Abraham&rsquo;s Oxfords were like
                    Stebbins&mdash;those shoes could carry him from here to the Golden Gate Bridge without so much as a
                    busted shoelace ... at least they looked that way.<br />&ldquo;That sounds pretty heartless,&rdquo;
                    he said finally.<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotten to be a pretty heartless situation.&rdquo; Abraham
                    wouldn&rsquo;t look at him.<br />&ldquo;Have you talked to all the others about this?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Not
                    yet. About a dozen.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s a real bitch. I can see how hard it is for

                    wearing his jacket, and it was soaked. His head was bent. One hip swayed and jutted awkwardly. His
                    left leg had stiffened up quite badly.<br />&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you take off your shirt?&rdquo; he
                    asked Abraham suddenly.<br />&ldquo;It was making my skin itch. It was raising hives or something.
                    It was a synthetic, maybe I have an allergy to synthetic fibers, how the hell should I know? What
                    do you say, Ray?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You look like a religious penitent or something.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What
                    do you say? Yes or no?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Maybe I owe McVries a couple.&rdquo; McVries was still
                    close by, but it was impossible to tell if he could hear their conversation over the din of the
                    crowd. Come on, McVries, he thought. Tell him I don&rsquo;t owe you anything. Come on, you son of a
                    bitch. But McVries said nothing.<br />&ldquo;All right, count me in,&rdquo; Garraty said.<br />&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;<br />Now

                    the jungle.&rdquo;<br />For a second he thought Abraham was going to get pissed, but his quickly
                    drawn-in breath came out in a harmless sigh. Maybe he was too tired to get pissed. &ldquo;You
                    agreed. I&rsquo;ll hold you to that, Ray.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Maybe I should get all high-flown and
                    say I&rsquo;ll keep my promise because my word is my bond,&rdquo; Garraty said. &ldquo;But
                    I&rsquo;ll be honest. I want to see you get that ticket, Abraham. The sooner the better.&rdquo;<br />Abraham
                    licked his lips. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>He looked around. McVries&rsquo;s head had dropped, and he was walking at the crowd, fast asleep.<br />&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
                    Garraty shouted. &ldquo;Hey, Pete! Pete!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; Stebbins said.

                    distinctly, and darted to McVries&rsquo;s side. He touched McVries&rsquo;s shoulders, setting him
                    straight again. McVries looked up at him sleepily and smiled. &ldquo;No, Ray. It&rsquo;s time to
                    sit down.&rdquo;<br />Terror pounded Garraty&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;No! No way!&rdquo;<br />McVries
                    looked at him for a moment, then smiled again and shook his head. He sat down, cross legged on the
                    pavement. He looked like a world-beaten monk. The scar on his cheek was a white slash in the rainy
                    gloom.<br />&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Garraty screamed.<br />He tried to pick McVries up, but, thin as he
                    was, McVries was much too heavy. McVries wouldn&rsquo;t even look at him. His eyes were shut. And
                    suddenly two of the soldiers were wrenching McVries away from him. They were putting their guns to
                    McVries&rsquo;s head.<br />&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Garraty screamed again. &ldquo;Me! Me! Shoot
                    me!&rdquo;<br />But instead, they gave him his third warning.<br />McVries opened his eyes and
                    smiled again. The next instant, he was gone.</p>

                        rode over him darkly</strong>, making him feel as if he were floating. The roar of the crowd
                    came to him
                    like the boom of the sea down a long, cone-shaped tunnel. Then it passed, but slowly.</p>

                    You&rsquo;ve been my friend, Garraty.&rdquo; Baker tried to smile. He stuck his hand blindly out,
                    and Garraty shook it with both of his.<br />&ldquo;Another time, another place,&rdquo; Baker said.<br />Garraty
                    put his hands over his face and had to bend over to keep walking. The sobs ripped out of him and

                    hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t hear the shots. But he did.
