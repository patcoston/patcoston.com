<h2>The 2-Minute Timer that counts down from 120</h2>

<div class="page">
<p>
"That's from the Long Walk the year before last," Olson said with grim satisfaction. "Kid was so scared he just <strong class="pop">froze up at nine o'clock</strong>."<br>
They considered the horror of it silently.<br>
"Just couldn't move. He took his three warnings and <strong class="pop">then at 9:02 AM they gave him his ticket</strong>. Right there by the starting post."
</p>

<p>"I don't know." Garraty paused. "I'll tell you something though. It's never going to be the same for me. <strong class="pop">The time limit thing</strong>. Even when you're walking with no warnings, there's only <strong class="pop">two minutes</strong> between you and the inside of a cemetery fence. That's not much time."</p>
<p>He was being second-warned, but of course he was beyond hearing, and when his <strong class="pop">two minutes</strong> were up they shot him like a dog.</p>
<p>By quarter of nine we'll be in Augusta, Garraty thought. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from there to Freeport. Depression dropped over him. What then? <strong class="pop">Two minutes</strong> you'll have to see her, unless you should miss her in the crowd-God forbid. Then what? Fold up?</p>
<p>The cramp loosened. Blood flowed back into the muscle, making it tingle with needles and pins, making it warm. The blond soldier with the remotely handsome face put away the <strong class="pop">pocket chronometer</strong>. His lips moved soundlessly as he <strong class="pop">counted down</strong> the last few seconds.</p>
<p>Someone up ahead was given a third warning and Garraty thought, I don't have any! <strong class="pop">I could sit down for a minute or a minute and a half</strong>.</p>
