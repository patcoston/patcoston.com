Why do you feel qualified to participate in The Long Walk?

I feel qualified to participate in the Long Walk because I am one useless S.O.B. and the world would be better off without me, unless I happened to win and get rich in which case I would buy a Van Go to put in every room of my manshun and order up sixty high-class horrs and not bother anybody. (I would give all my sixty high-class horrs old-age pensions, too.)
