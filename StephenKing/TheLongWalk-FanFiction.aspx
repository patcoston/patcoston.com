<strong>Preamble:</strong> Stebbins and McVries are my two favorite characters.
I've come up with many <a href="TheLongWalk-Conspiracy.aspx">cospiracy-theories</a> which I thought would make a good story to
explain all the unexplainable things that happen.

Garraty Epilogue:

The Dark Figure is simply his mom in her black coat.  He's simply hallucinating from sleep deprivation and his eyes are bleary.
He has a happy reunion with his mom and Janice, then recovers in the hospital where he gets a visit from the Major.
He gets plastic feet.
We find out Garraty's wish is for his father to be released from The Squads and be reunited with his family.
He tells the Major about his bastard son Stebbins.  He visits Baker's parents and tells them of his wishes to have a lead-lined coffin.
He gives Baker that lead-lined coffin.  He goes a little overboard and gets his body entombed with liquid lead.
He visits Scramm's wife and sets her and her baby up for life financially, and tells her about the house he wanted to build on the hill.
He visits McVries parents and tells them how their son sacrificed his life for his.
He marries Janice.
A couple years later, when he's 18, he writes a book about The Long Walk 1979 and dedicates it to Harkness.

I'd then write that book that Garraty wrote about his experiences, once he had some perspective and hindsight and could talk about
his motivations and the struggles he had.  The book would be titled "How to win The Long Walk".
It's not really a "how to" book, but it is about how and why he won the it, even though he almost died many times.
